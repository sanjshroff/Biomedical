29680748,The Evolution of Gene Expression in cis and trans.,"There is abundant variation in gene expression between individuals, populations, and species. The evolution of gene regulation and expression within and between species is thought to frequently contribute to adaptation. Yet considerable evidence suggests that the primary evolutionary force acting on variation in gene expression is stabilizing selection. We review here the results of recent studies characterizing the evolution of gene expression occurring in cis (via linked polymorphisms) or in trans (through diffusible products of other genes) and their contribution to adaptation and response to the environment. We review the evidence for buffering of variation in gene expression at the level of both transcription and translation, and the possible mechanisms for this buffering. Lastly, we summarize unresolved questions about the evolution of gene regulation.","Animals Evolution, Molecular Gene Expression/*genetics Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics Humans Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics","The Evolution of Gene Expression in cis and trans.

30875273,Gene expression variability: the other dimension in transcriptome analysis.,"Transcriptome sequencing is a powerful technique to study molecular changes that underlie the differences in physiological conditions and disease progression. A typical question that is posed in such studies is finding genes with significant changes between sample groups. In this respect expression variability is regarded as a nuisance factor that is primarily of technical origin and complicates the data analysis. However, it is becoming apparent that the biological variation in gene expression might be an important molecular phenotype that can affect physiological parameters. In this review we explore the recent literature on technical and biological variability in gene expression, sources of expression variability, (epi-)genetic hallmarks, and evolutionary constraints in genes with robust and variable gene expression. We provide an overview of recent findings on effects of external cues, such as diet and aging, on expression variability and on other biological phenomena that can be linked to it. We discuss metrics and tools that were developed for quantification of expression variability and highlight the importance of future studies in this direction. To assist the adoption of expression variability analysis, we also provide a detailed description and computer code, which can easily be utilized by other researchers. We also provide a reanalysis of recently published data to highlight the value of the analysis method.","Epigenomics Gene Expression Profiling/*methods High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods Transcriptome/genetics/physiology","Gene expression variability: the other dimension in transcriptome analysis.

We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN and to characterize their circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns. We identified eight major cell types, with each type displaying a specific pattern of circadian gene expression. Five SCN neuronal subtypes, each with specific combinations of markers, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light responsiveness. Through a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse SCN at single-cell resolution, we obtained a standardized SCN atlas containing the spatial distribution of these subtypes and gene expression. Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous circadian gene expression between SCN neuron subtypes.

Increasing evidence has confirmed that chromatin regulators (CRs) are involved in cancer progression. Therefore, we aimed to explore the function and prognostic value of CRs in BLCA patients. METHODS: Chromatin regulators (CRs) were acquired from the previous top research. The mRNA expression and clinical information were downloaded from TCGA and GEO datasets. Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis were performed to select the prognostic gene and construct the risk model for predicting outcome in BLCA. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the prognosis between high- and low-risk groups. We also investigated the drug sensitivity difference between high- and low-risk groups. CMAP dataset was performed to screen the small molecule drugs for treatment. RESULTS: We successfully constructed and validated an 11 CRs-based model for predicting the prognosis of patients with BLCA. Moreover, we also found 11 CRs-based model was an independent prognostic factor. Functional analysis suggested that CRs were mainly enriched in cancer-related signaling pathways. The CR-based model was also correlated with immune cells infiltration and immune checkpoint. Patients in the high-risk group were more sensitive to several drugs, such as mitomycin C, gemcitabine, cisplatin. Eight small molecule drugs could be beneficial to treatment for BLCA patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study provided novel insights into the function of CRs in BLCA. We identified a reliable prognostic biomarker for the survival of patients with BLCA.","Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics Chromatin Humans *Pharmaceutical Preparations Prognosis *Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics","Identification of a chromatin regulator signature and potential candidate drugs for bladder cancer.

The development of novel drugs/agents requires a huge amount of cost and time that represents a major challenge for drug discovery. In the last three decades, the number of FDA approved drugs has dropped down and this led to increasing interest in drug reposition or repurposing. The present review focuses on recent concepts and therapeutic opportunities for the utilization of antidiabetics, antibiotics, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antipsychotic, PDE inhibitors and estrogen receptor antagonist, Antabuse, antiparasitic and cardiovascular agents/drugs as an alternative approach against human malignancies. The repurposing of approved non-cancerous drugs is an effective strategy to develop new therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer patients at an affordable cost in clinics. In the current scenario, most of the countries throughout the globe are unable to meet the medical needs of cancer patients because of the high cost of the available cancerous drugs. Some of these drugs displayed potential anti-cancer activity in preclinic and clinical studies by regulating several key molecular mechanisms and oncogenic pathways in human malignancies.

33188892,EGFR targeting for cancer therapy: Pharmacology and immunoconjugates with drugs and nanoparticles.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptors family and is present in the epithelial cell membrane. Its endogenous activation occurs through the binding of different endogenous ligands, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to signaling cascades able to maintain normal cellular functions. Although involved in the development and maintenance of tissues in normal conditions, when EGFR is overexpressed, it stimulates the growth and progression of tumors, resulting in angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, through some main cascades such as Ras/Raf/MAPK, PIK-3/AKT, PLC-PKC and STAT. Besides, considering the limitations of conventional chemotherapy that result in high toxicity and low tumor specificity, EGFR is currently considered an important target. As a result, several monoclonal antibodies are currently approved for use in cancer treatment, such as cetuximab (CTX), panitumumab, nimotuzumab, necitumumab and others are in clinical trials. Aiming to combine the chemotherapeutic agent toxicity and specific targeting to EGFR overexpressing tumor tissues, two main strategies will be discussed in this review: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and antibody-nanoparticle conjugates (ANCs). Briefly, ADCs consist of antibodies covalently linked through a spacer to the cytotoxic drug. Upon administration, binding to EGFR and endocytosis, ADCs suffer chemical and enzymatic reactions leading to the release and accumulation of the drug. Instead, ANCs consist of nanotechnology-based formulations, such as lipid, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles able to protect the drug against inactivation, allowing controlled release and also passive accumulation in tumor tissues by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Furthermore, ANCs undergo active targeting through EGFR receptor-mediated endocytosis, leading to the formation of lysosomes and drug release into the cytosol. Herein, we will present and discuss some important aspects regarding EGFR structure, its role on internal signaling pathways and downregulation aspects. Then, considering that EGFR is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy, the monoclonal antibodies able to target this receptor will be presented and discussed. Finally, ADCs and ANCs state of the art will be reviewed and recent studies and clinical progresses will be highlighted.

It is a heterogeneous disease that presents different entities, different biological characteristics, and differentiated clinical behaviors. With this in mind, this literature review had as its main objective to analyze the path taken from the simple use of classical drugs to the application of mathematical models, which through the many ongoing studies, have been considered as one of the reliable strategies, explaining the reasons why chemotherapy is not always successful. Besides, the most commonly mentioned strategies are immunotherapy, which includes techniques and therapies such as the use of antibodies, cytokines, antitumor vaccines, oncolytic and genomic viruses, among others, and nanoparticles, including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, liposome, dendrimer, micelle, and others, as well as drug reuse, which is a process by which new therapeutic indications are found for existing and approved drugs. The most commonly used pharmacological categories are cardiac, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, antiviral, antibiotic, and others. For the efficient development of reused drugs, there must be a process of exchange of purposes, methods, and information already available, and for their better understanding, computational mathematical models are then used, of which the methods of blind search or screening, based on the target, knowledge, signature, pathway or network and the mechanism to which it is directed, stand out.

Thus, cancer persistence is a major obstacle to curing cancers, where insight into the biology of DTP cells and therapeutic strategies targeting this mechanism can have considerable clinical implications. There is emerging evidence that DTP cells adapt to new environments through epigenomic modification, transcriptomic regulation, flexible energy metabolism, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment.

In recent years, several pharmacogenetic guidelines have been published by international scientific consortia, but the uptake in clinical practice is still poor. Many coordinated international efforts are ongoing in order to overcome the existing barriers to pharmacogenomic implementation. On the other hand, existing validated pharmacogenomic markers can explain only a minor part of the observed clinical variability in the therapeutic outcome. New investigational approaches are warranted, including the study of the pharmacogenomic role of the immune system genetics and of previously neglected rare genetic variants, reported to account for a large part of the inter-individual variability in drug metabolism. In this Special Issue, we collected a series of articles covering many aspects of pharmacogenomics.

New investigational approaches are warranted, including the study of the pharmacogenomic role of the immune system genetics and of previously neglected rare genetic variants, reported to account for a large part of the inter-individual variability in drug metabolism. In this Special Issue, we collected a series of articles covering many aspects of pharmacogenomics. These include clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, development of tools or infrastractures to support this process, research of new pharmacogenomics markers to increase drug efficacy and safety, and the impact of rare genetic variants in pharmacogenomics. *Biomarkers Humans *Pharmacogenetics Pharmacogenomic Testing *Precision Medicine",pharmacogenom person medicin pharmacogenom one emerg approach precis medicin tailor drug select dose patient genet featur recent year sever pharmacogenet guidelin publish intern scientif consortia uptak clinic practic still poor mani coordin intern effort ongo order overcom exist barrier pharmacogenom implement hand exist valid pharmacogenom marker explain minor part observ clinic variabl therapeut outcom new investig approach warrant includ studi pharmacogenom role immun system genet previous neglect rare genet variant report account larg part variabl drug metabol special issu collect seri articl cover mani aspect pharmacogenom includ clinic implement pharmacogenom clinic practic develop tool infrastractur support process research new pharmacogenom marker increas drug efficaci safeti impact rare genet variant pharmacogenom human pharmacogenom test medicin,2
28582322,Atopic dermatitis phenotypes and the need for personalized medicine.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent developments in therapies which target the molecular mechanisms in atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Current advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of atopic dermatitis are leading to the stratification of different atopic dermatitis phenotypes. New therapies offer the option to target-specific molecules involved in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. Current new therapies under investigation aim to modulate specific inflammatory pathways associated with distinctive atopic dermatitis phenotypes, which would potentially translate into the development of personalized, targeted-specific treatments of atopic dermatitis. SUMMARY: Despite the unmet need for well tolerated, effective, and personalized treatment of atopic dermatitis, the current standard treatments of atopic dermatitis do not focus on the individual pathogenesis of the disease. The development of targeted, phenotype-specific therapies has the potential to open a new promising era of individualized treatment of atopic dermatitis.","Biomarkers/metabolism Dermatitis, Atopic/*diagnosis/*metabolism/*therapy Humans Precision Medicine/*methods/trends","Atopic dermatitis phenotypes and the need for personalized medicine.

29076109,A Review of Food-Drug Interactions on Oral Drug Absorption.,"Food effect, also known as food-drug interactions, is a common phenomenon associated with orally administered medications and can be defined as changes in absorption rate or absorption extent. The mechanisms of food effect and their consequences can involve multiple factors, including human post-prandial physiology, properties of the drug, and how the drug is administered. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these mechanisms when recommending whether a specific drug should be taken with or without food. Food-drug interactions can be clinically relevant, especially when they must be avoided to prevent undesirable effects or exploited to optimize medication therapy. This review conducts a literature search that examined studies on food effect. We summarized the literature and identified and discussed common food effect mechanisms.

Among 46 finally included RCTs, six RCTs simply addressed pharmacodynamic interactions and 33 RCTs studied pharmacokinetic interactions, whereas seven RCTs investigated both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Twenty-two juice-drug combinations showed potential clinical relevance.

30974173,The mechanisms of pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions - A perspective from the UNGAP group.,"The simultaneous intake of food and drugs can have a strong impact on drug release, absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination and consequently, on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy. As such, food-drug interactions are one of the main challenges in oral drug administration. Whereas pharmacokinetic (PK) food-drug interactions can have a variety of causes, pharmacodynamic (PD) food-drug interactions occur due to specific pharmacological interactions between a drug and particular drinks or food. In recent years, extensive efforts were made to elucidate the mechanisms that drive pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions. Their occurrence depends mainly on the properties of the drug substance, the formulation and a multitude of physiological factors. Every intake of food or drink changes the physiological conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a precise understanding of how different foods and drinks affect the processes of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination as well as formulation performance is important in order to be able to predict and avoid such interactions. Furthermore, it must be considered that beverages such as milk, grapefruit juice and alcohol can also lead to specific food-drug interactions. In this regard, the growing use of food supplements and functional food requires urgent attention in oral pharmacotherapy. Recently, a new consortium in Understanding Gastrointestinal Absorption-related Processes (UNGAP) was established through COST, a funding organisation of the European Union supporting translational research across Europe.

30458907,Clinically Significant Food-Drug Interactions.,"OBJECTIVE: Provide an up-to-date review for health care providers regarding clinically significant food-drug interactions and summarize recommendations for optimal medication administration in older adults and long-term care patients. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and IPA abstracts to locate relevant articles published between January 1982 and July 2017. DAILYMED was used to identify manufacturer-specific medication administration recommendations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed for inclusion based on their relevance to this subject matter and the integrity of the information provided. Additionally, the package labeling of included products was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current recommendations for specific medication administration with regard to food are summarized descriptively. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant food-drug interactions are common and have been reported with multiple classes of medications. However, there are a limited number of studies examining food-drug interactions, and the majority of recommendations are made by product-specific manufacturers. Pharmacists should be aware of common food-drug interactions in the community, assisted living, long-term care, subacute care, and hospital settings. To optimize medication therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes, it is important for pharmacists and other health care providers to identify agents with potential for food-drug interactions and to understand the clinical relevance of such interactions.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Enteral Nutrition *Food-Drug Interactions Humans Medication Therapy Management Pharmacists","Clinically Significant Food-Drug Interactions.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and IPA abstracts to locate relevant articles published between January 1982 and July 2017. DAILYMED was used to identify manufacturer-specific medication administration recommendations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed for inclusion based on their relevance to this subject matter and the integrity of the information provided. Additionally, the package labeling of included products was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current recommendations for specific medication administration with regard to food are summarized descriptively. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant food-drug interactions are common and have been reported with multiple classes of medications. However, there are a limited number of studies examining food-drug interactions, and the majority of recommendations are made by product-specific manufacturers. Pharmacists should be aware of common food-drug interactions in the community, assisted living, long-term care, subacute care, and hospital settings. To optimize medication therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes, it is important for pharmacists and other health care providers to identify agents with potential for food-drug interactions and to understand the clinical relevance of such interactions.

34445237,The Clinical Significance of Drug-Food Interactions of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Patients treated with anticoagulants should avoid products containing St. John's wort and take special care with other food ingredients. As the interest in dietary supplements is on the rise, healthcare providers can contribute to the development of well-designed clinical trials on interactions between DOACs and food, and distribute sufficient knowledge about the proper use of these supplements among patients.","Administration, Oral *Anticoagulants/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use *Dietary Supplements *Food-Drug Interactions Humans *Vitamin K/antagonists & inhibitors/blood","The Clinical Significance of Drug-Food Interactions of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.

27914234,"Food, gastrointestinal pH, and models of oral drug absorption.","This article reviews the major physiological and physicochemical principles of the effect of food and gastrointestinal (GI) pH on the absorption and bioavailability of oral drugs, and the various absorption models that are used to describe/predict oral drug absorption. The rate and extent of oral drug absorption is determined by a complex interaction between a drug's physicochemical properties, GI physiologic factors, and the nature of the formulation administered. GI pH is an important factor that can markedly affect oral drug absorption and bioavailability as it may have significant influence on drug dissolution & solubility, drug release, drug stability, and intestinal permeability. Different regions of the GI tract have different drug absorptive properties. Thus, the transit time in each GI region and its variability between subjects may contribute to the variability in the rate and/or extent of drug absorption. Food-drug interactions can result in delayed, decreased, increased, and sometimes un-altered drug absorption. Food effects on oral absorption can be achieved by direct and indirect mechanisms. Various models have been proposed to describe oral absorption ranging from empirical models to the more sophisticated ""mechanism-based"" models. Through understanding of the physicochemical and physiological rate-limiting factors affecting oral absorption, modellers can implement simplified population-based modelling approaches that are less complex than whole-body physiologically-based models but still capture the essential elements in a physiological way and hence will be more suited for population modelling of large clinical data sets. It will also help formulation scientists to better predict formulation performance and to develop formulations that maximize oral bioavailability.","Administration, Oral Aged Biological Availability *Food-Drug Interactions Gastrointestinal Tract/*metabolism Humans *Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Pharmacokinetics Solubility","Food, gastrointestinal pH, and models of oral drug absorption.

31571167,Transporter-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions and Their Significance.,"Drug transporters are considered to be determinants of drug disposition and effects/toxicities by affecting the absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs. Drug transporters are generally divided into solute carrier (SLC) family and ATP binding cassette (ABC) family. Widely studied ABC family transporters include P-glycoprotein (P-GP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs). SLC family transporters related to drug transport mainly include organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), organic anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters (OCTs), organic cation/carnitine transporters (OCTNs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and multidrug/toxin extrusions (MATEs). These transporters are often expressed in tissues related to drug disposition, such as the small intestine, liver, and kidney, implicating intestinal absorption of drugs, uptake of drugs into hepatocytes, and renal/bile excretion of drugs. Most of therapeutic drugs are their substrates or inhibitors. When they are comedicated, serious drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may occur due to alterations in intestinal absorption, hepatic uptake, or renal/bile secretion of drugs, leading to enhancement of their activities or toxicities or therapeutic failure.

27864593,Toxicogenomics in Environmental Science.,"This chapter reviews the current knowledge and recent progress in the field of environmental, aquatic ecotoxicogenomics with a focus on transcriptomic methods. In ecotoxicogenomics the omics technologies are applied for the detection and assessment of adverse effects in the environment, and thus are to be distinguished from omics used in human toxicology [Snape et al., Aquat Toxicol 67:143-154, 2004]. Transcriptomic methods in ecotoxicology are applied to gain a mechanistic understanding of toxic effects on organisms or populations, and thus aim to bridge the gap between cause and effect. A worthwhile effect-based interpretation of stressor induced changes on the transcriptome is based on the principle of phenotypic-anchoring [Paules, Environ Health Perspect 111:A338-A339, 2003]. Thereby, changes on the transcriptomic level can only be identified as effects if they are clearly linked to a specific stressor-induced effect on the macroscopic level. By integrating those macroscopic and transcriptomic effects, conclusions on the effect-inducing type of the stressor can be drawn. Stressor-specific effects on the transcriptomic level can be identified as stressor-specific induced pathways, transcriptomic patterns, or stressors-specific genetic biomarkers. In this chapter, examples of the combined application of macroscopic and transcriptional effects for the identification of environmental stressors, such as aquatic pollutants, are given and discussed. By means of these examples, challenges on the way to a standardized application of transcriptomics in ecotoxicology are discussed.

32087008,"The promise of toxicogenomics for genetic toxicology: past, present and future.","Toxicogenomics, the application of genomics to toxicology, was described as 'a new era' for toxicology. Standard toxicity tests typically involve a number of short-term bioassays that are costly, time consuming, require large numbers of animals and generally focus on a single end point.

Gene expression microarrays could measure and characterise genome-wide gene expression changes in a single study and while transcriptomic profiles that can discriminate between genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens have been identified, challenges with the approach limited its application.

To cope with this task, it is a prerequisite to obtain detailed information on the extent of chemical perturbations of biological pathways, in particular, adaptive vs. adverse effects and the dose-response relationships. This knowledge serves as the basis for the classification of non-carcinogens and carcinogens and for further distinguishing carcinogens in genotoxic (DNA damaging) or non-genotoxic compounds. Basing on quantitative dose-response relationships, points of departures can be derived for chemical risk assessment. In recent years, new methods have shown their capability to support the established rodent models of carcinogenicity testing. In vitro high throughput screening assays assess more comprehensively cell response. In addition, omics technologies were applied to study the mode of action of chemicals whereby the term ""toxicogenomics"" comprises various technologies such as transcriptomics, epigenomics, or metabolomics. This review aims to summarize the current state of toxicogenomic approaches in risk science and to compare them with established ones. For example, measurement of global transcriptional changes generates meaningful information for toxicological risk assessment such as accurate classification of genotoxic/non-genotoxic carcinogens. Alteration in mRNA expression offers previously unknown insights in the mode of action and enables the definition of key events. Based on these, benchmark doses can be calculated for the transition from an adaptive to an adverse state. In short, this review assesses the potential and challenges of transcriptomics and addresses the impact of other omics technologies on risk assessment in terms of hazard identification and dose-response assessment.","Carcinogenicity Tests *Carcinogens Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Risk Assessment *Toxicogenetics","Toxicogenomics - What added Value Do These Approaches Provide for Carcinogen Risk Assessment?

With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. RESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement).

31557052,Generating the Blood Exposome Database Using a Comprehensive Text Mining and Database Fusion Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 compounds to blood-related primary publications.

33953899,Text Mining-Based Drug Discovery in Osteoarthritis.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative joint disease, which causes stiffness, pain, and decreased function. At the early stage of OA, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the first-line treatment. However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies are limited. We aim to use bioinformatics to identify potential genes and drugs associated with OA. METHODS: The genes related to OA and NSAIDs therapy were determined by text mining. Then, the common genes were performed for GO, KEGG pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Using the MCODE plugin-obtained hub genes, the expression levels of hub genes were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The confirmed genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database to determine potential genes and drugs. RESULTS: The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression level of 15 genes was significantly increased in OA samples. Finally, eight potential genes were targetable to a total of 53 drugs, twenty-one of which have been employed to treat OA and 32 drugs have not yet been used in OA. CONCLUSIONS: The 15 genes (including PTGS2, NLRP3, MMP9, IL1RN, CCL2, TNF, IL10, CD40, IL6, NGF, TP53, RELA, BCL2L1, VEGFA, and NOTCH1) and 32 drugs, which have not been used in OA but approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be potential genes and drugs, respectively, to improve OA treatment.

Using the MCODE plugin-obtained hub genes, the expression levels of hub genes were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The confirmed genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database to determine potential genes and drugs. RESULTS: The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression level of 15 genes was significantly increased in OA samples. Finally, eight potential genes were targetable to a total of 53 drugs, twenty-one of which have been employed to treat OA and 32 drugs have not yet been used in OA. CONCLUSIONS: The 15 genes (including PTGS2, NLRP3, MMP9, IL1RN, CCL2, TNF, IL10, CD40, IL6, NGF, TP53, RELA, BCL2L1, VEGFA, and NOTCH1) and 32 drugs, which have not been used in OA but approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be potential genes and drugs, respectively, to improve OA treatment. Additionally, those methods provided tremendous opportunities to facilitate drug repositioning efforts and study novel target pharmacology in the pharmaceutical industry.

30937439,Open Agile text mining for bioinformatics: the PubAnnotation ecosystem.,"MOTIVATION: Most currently available text mining tools share two characteristics that make them less than optimal for use by biomedical researchers: they require extensive specialist skills in natural language processing and they were built on the assumption that they should optimize global performance metrics on representative datasets. This is a problem because most end-users are not natural language processing specialists and because biomedical researchers often care less about global metrics like F-measure or representative datasets than they do about more granular metrics such as precision and recall on their own specialized datasets. Thus, there are fundamental mismatches between the assumptions of much text mining work and the preferences of potential end-users. RESULTS: This article introduces the concept of Agile text mining, and presents the PubAnnotation ecosystem as an example implementation. The system approaches the problems from two perspectives: it allows the reformulation of text mining by biomedical researchers from the task of assembling a complete system to the task of retrieving warehoused annotations, and it makes it possible to do very targeted customization of the pre-existing system to address specific end-user requirements. Two use cases are presented: assisted curation of the GlycoEpitope database, and assessing coverage in the literature of pre-eclampsia-associated genes.

Worldwide efforts have been made to that aim and, as well as in other therapeutic areas, chemoinformatics have contributed significantly to leishmaniasis drug discovery. Breakthrough advances in the comprehension of the parasites' molecular biology have enabled the design of high-affinity ligands for a number of macromolecular targets.

This review presents the efforts engaged by Ineris more recently in the field of chemoinformatics to develop and use new predictive methods for the anticipation and management of industrials risks associated to energetic and reactive materials as a complement to experiments. An overview of the methods used for the development of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for physical hazards are presented and discussed regarding the specificities associated to this class of properties. A review of models developed at Ineris is also provided from the first tentative models on the explosivity of nitro compounds to the successful application to the flammability of organic mixtures. Then, a discussion is proposed on the use of QSPR models. Good practices for robust use for QSPR models are recalled with specific comments related to physical hazards, notably for regulatory purpose. Dissemination and training efforts engaged by Ineris are also presented. The potential offered by these predictive methods in terms of in silico design and for the development of new intrinsically safer technologies in safety-by-design strategies is finally discussed.

An overview of the methods used for the development of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for physical hazards are presented and discussed regarding the specificities associated to this class of properties. A review of models developed at Ineris is also provided from the first tentative models on the explosivity of nitro compounds to the successful application to the flammability of organic mixtures. Then, a discussion is proposed on the use of QSPR models. Good practices for robust use for QSPR models are recalled with specific comments related to physical hazards, notably for regulatory purpose. Dissemination and training efforts engaged by Ineris are also presented. The potential offered by these predictive methods in terms of in silico design and for the development of new intrinsically safer technologies in safety-by-design strategies is finally discussed. At last, challenges and perspectives to extend the application of chemoinformatics in the field of safety and in particular for the physical hazards of energetic and reactive substances are proposed. *Cheminformatics Nitro Compounds *Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship",chemoinformat safeti energet reactiv materi ineri character physic hazard substanc key inform manag risk associ use storag transport decad work area ineri develop implement experiment facil allow character differ scale various condit studi dread accid scenario review present effort engag ineri recent field chemoinformat develop use new predict method anticip manag industri risk associ energet reactiv materi complement experi overview method use develop quantit relationship physic hazard present discuss regard specif associ class properti review model develop ineri also provid first tentat model explos nitro compound success applic flammabl organ mixtur discuss propos use qspr model good practic robust use qspr model recal specif comment relat physic hazard notabl regulatori purpos dissemin train effort engag ineri also present potenti offer predict method term silico design develop new intrins safer technolog strategi final discuss last challeng perspect extend applic chemoinformat field safeti particular physic hazard energet reactiv substanc propos nitro compound relationship,8

34991982,An update on drugs with therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century with more than 257 million cases and over 5.17 million deaths reported worldwide (as of November 23, 2021. Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved. Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332). Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint). However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases. Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic. In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID™ summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses. Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity. The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.","Adult Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use *COVID-19/therapy Humans Immunization, Passive Lactams Leucine Nitriles Pandemics *Pharmaceutical Preparations Proline Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic SARS-CoV-2 Treatment Outcome","An update on drugs with therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment.

Although unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS.

BNT162b2 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the expression of which elicits immune responses against the antigen in recipients. In early December 2020, BNT162b2 received a temporary emergency use authorization (EUA) in the UK and, subsequently, a series of approvals or authorizations for emergency use in Bahrain, Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the USA. Soon after, BNT162b2 received conditional marketing authorizations in Switzerland (19 December 2020) and the EU (21 December 2020) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older. BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly in a two-dose regimen. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of BNT162b2 leading to these first approvals for the prevention of COVID-19.

As of today, there are three U.S Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Also, the antiviral drug remdesivir and two combinations of monoclonal antibodies are authorized for Emergency use (EUA) in certain patients. Furthermore, baricitinib was approved in Japan (April 23, 2021). Despite available vaccines and EUA, pharmacological therapy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is still highly required. There are several ongoing clinical trials investigating the efficacy of clinically available drugs in treating COVID-19. In this study, selected novel pharmacological agents for the possible treatment of COVID-19 will be discussed. Point of discussion will cover mechanism of action, supporting evidence for safety and efficacy and reached stage in development. Drugs were classified into three classes according to the phase of viral life cycle they target. Phase I, the early infective phase, relies on supportive care and symptomatic treatment as needed. In phase II, the pulmonary phase, treatment aims at inhibiting viral entry or replication. Drugs used during this phase are famotidine, monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, ivermectin, remdesivir, camostat mesylate and other antiviral agents. Finally, phase III, the hyper-inflammatory phase, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and melatonin are used.

Even with the recent approval of the anti-viral drug, remdesivir, and Emergency Use Authorization of monoclonal antibodies against S protein, bamlanivimab and casirimab/imdevimab, efficient and safe COVID-19 vaccines are still desperately demanded not only to prevent its spread but also to restore social and economic activities via generating mass immunization. Recent Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine may provide a pathway forward, but monitoring of long-term immunity is still required, and diverse candidates are still under development. As the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and interactions with the immune system continues to evolve, a variety of drug candidates are under investigation and in clinical trials. Potential vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 include repurposed drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antiviral and antigenic proteins, peptides, and genetically engineered viruses.
