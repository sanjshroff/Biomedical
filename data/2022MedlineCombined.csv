30443215,Chemoinformatics Strategies for Leishmaniasis Drug Discovery.,"Leishmaniasis is a fatal neglected tropical disease (NTD) that is caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania parasites. The disease kills approximately 20,000 people each year and more than 1 billion are susceptible to infection. Although counting on a few compounds, the therapeutic arsenal faces some drawbacks such as drug resistance, toxicity issues, high treatment costs, and accessibility problems, which highlight the need for novel treatment options. Worldwide efforts have been made to that aim and, as well as in other therapeutic areas, chemoinformatics have contributed significantly to leishmaniasis drug discovery. Breakthrough advances in the comprehension of the parasites' molecular biology have enabled the design of high-affinity ligands for a number of macromolecular targets. In addition, the use of chemoinformatics has allowed highly accurate predictions of biological activity and physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties of novel antileishmanial compounds. This review puts into perspective the current context of leishmaniasis drug discovery and focuses on the use of chemoinformatics to develop better therapies for this life-threatening condition.",

Data on outputs in the field, and citations to those outputs, were obtained by means of topic searches of the Web of Science Core Collection. The searches demonstrate that chemoinformatics is by now a well-defined sub-discipline of chemistry, and one that forms an essential part of the chemical educational curriculum. There are three core journals for the subject: The Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, the Journal of Cheminformatics, and Molecular Informatics, and, having established itself, chemoinformatics is now starting to export knowledge to disciplines outside of chemistry.",*Bibliometrics Cheminformatics/*trends Humans Journal Impact Factor Publications/*trends
32084340,A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery.,"Due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, there is a growing need to discover new antibiotics. To address this challenge, we trained a deep neural network capable of predicting molecules with antibacterial activity. We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub-halicin-that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics. This work highlights the utility of deep learning approaches to expand our antibiotic arsenal through the discovery of structurally distinct antibacterial molecules.","Acinetobacter baumannii/drug effects Animals Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology Cheminformatics/methods Clostridioides difficile/drug effects Databases, Chemical Drug Discovery/*methods *Machine Learning Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Inbred C57BL Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/pharmacology Thiadiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology"

34762411,Chemoinformatics View on Bitter Taste Receptor Agonists in Food.,"Food compounds with a bitter taste have a role in human health, both for their capability to influence food choice and preferences and for their possible systemic effect due to the modulation of extra-oral bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). Investigating the interaction of bitter food compounds with TAS2Rs is a key step to unravel their complex effects on health and to pave the way to rationally design new additives for food formulation or drugs. Here, we propose a collection of food bitter compounds, for which in vitro activity data against TAS2Rs are available. The patterns of TAS2R subtype-specific agonists were analyzed using scaffold decomposition and chemical space analysis, providing a detailed characterization of the associations between food bitter tastants and TAS2Rs.","Cheminformatics Humans *Pharmaceutical Preparations Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics Taste *Taste Buds"

31711994,Repurposing of drugs as STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.,"Drug repurposing is a valuable approach in delivering new cancer therapeutics rapidly into the clinic. Existing safety and patient tolerability data for drugs already in clinical use represent an untapped resource in terms of identifying therapeutic agents for off-label protein targets. The multicellular effects of STAT3 mediated by a range of various upstream signaling pathways make it an attractive therapeutic target with utility in a range of diseases including cancer, and has led to the development of a variety of STAT3 inhibitors. Moreover, heightened STAT3 transcriptional activation in tumor cells and within the cells of the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease progression. Consequently, there are many STAT3 inhibitors in preclinical development or under evaluation in clinical trials for their therapeutic efficacy predominantly in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Despite these advances, many challenges remain in ultimately providing STAT3 inhibitors to patients as cancer treatments, highlighting the need not only for a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with STAT3 activation, but also how various pharmaceutical agents suppress STAT3 activity in various cancers. In this review we discuss the importance of STAT3-dependent functions in cancer, review the status of compounds designed as direct-acting STAT3 inhibitors, and describe some of the strategies for repurposing of drugs as STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",Animals Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use *Drug Discovery Drug Repositioning/*methods Humans Neoplasms/*drug therapy Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors

While antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now clinically established for cancer therapy, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) are gaining recognition as a new modality for targeted drug delivery with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for cancer treatment. The linker in a drug conjugate plays a key role in the circulation time of the conjugate and release of the drug for full activity at the target site.

35125116,Identification of a chromatin regulator signature and potential candidate drugs for bladder cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a malignant tumor withÂ a dismay outcome. Increasing evidence has confirmed that chromatin regulators (CRs) are involved in cancer progression. Therefore, we aimed to explore the function and prognostic value of CRs in BLCA patients. METHODS: Chromatin regulators (CRs) were acquired from the previous top research. The mRNA expression and clinical information were downloaded from TCGA and GEO datasets. Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis were performed to select the prognostic gene and construct the risk model for predicting outcome in BLCA. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the prognosis between high- and low-risk groups. We also investigated the drug sensitivity difference between high- and low-risk groups. CMAP dataset was performed to screen the small molecule drugs for treatment. RESULTS: We successfully constructed and validated an 11 CRs-based model for predicting the prognosis of patients with BLCA. Moreover, we also found 11 CRs-based model was anÂ independent prognostic factor. Functional analysis suggested that CRs were mainly enriched in cancer-related signaling pathways. The CR-based model was also correlated with immune cells infiltration and immune checkpoint. Patients in the high-risk group were more sensitive to several drugs, such as mitomycin C, gemcitabine, cisplatin. Eight small molecule drugs could be beneficial to treatment for BLCA patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study provided novel insights into the function of CRs in BLCA. We identified a reliable prognostic biomarker for the survival of patients with BLCA.","Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics Chromatin Humans *Pharmaceutical Preparations Prognosis *Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics"
32380233,Repurposing of drugs: An attractive pharmacological strategy for cancer therapeutics.,"Human malignancies are one of the major health-related issues though out the world and anticipated to rise in the future. The development of novel drugs/agents requires a huge amount of cost and time that represents a major challenge for drug discovery. In the last three decades, the number of FDA approved drugs has dropped down and this led to increasing interest in drug reposition or repurposing. The present review focuses on recent concepts and therapeutic opportunities for the utilization of antidiabetics, antibiotics, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antipsychotic, PDE inhibitors and estrogen receptor antagonist, Antabuse, antiparasitic and cardiovascular agents/drugs as an alternative approach against human malignancies. The repurposing of approved non-cancerous drugs is an effective strategy to develop new therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer patients at an affordable cost in clinics. In the current scenario, most of the countries throughout the globe are unable to meet the medical needs of cancer patients because of the high cost of the available cancerous drugs. Some of these drugs displayed potential anti-cancer activity in preclinic and clinical studies by regulating several key molecular mechanisms and oncogenic pathways in human malignancies. The emerging pieces of evidence indicate that repurposing of drugs is crucial to the faster and cheaper discovery of anti-cancerous drugs.",Animals Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use *Drug Discovery Drug Repositioning/*methods Humans Neoplasms/*drug therapy Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage
33188892,EGFR targeting for cancer therapy: Pharmacology and immunoconjugates with drugs and nanoparticles.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the tyrosine kinase receptors family and is present in the epithelial cell membrane. Its endogenous activation occurs through the binding of different endogenous ligands, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to signaling cascades able to maintain normal cellular functions. Although involved in the development and maintenance of tissues in normal conditions, when EGFR is overexpressed, it stimulates the growth and progression of tumors, resulting in angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, through some main cascades such as Ras/Raf/MAPK, PIK-3/AKT, PLC-PKC and STAT. Besides, considering the limitations of conventional chemotherapy that result in high toxicity and low tumor specificity, EGFR is currently considered an important target. As a result, several monoclonal antibodies are currently approved for use in cancer treatment, such as cetuximab (CTX), panitumumab, nimotuzumab, necitumumab and others are in clinical trials. Aiming to combine the chemotherapeutic agent toxicity and specific targeting to EGFR overexpressing tumor tissues, two main strategies will be discussed in this review: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and antibody-nanoparticle conjugates (ANCs). Briefly, ADCs consist of antibodies covalently linked through a spacer to the cytotoxic drug. Upon administration, binding to EGFR and endocytosis, ADCs suffer chemical and enzymatic reactions leading to the release and accumulation of the drug. Instead, ANCs consist of nanotechnology-based formulations, such as lipid, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles able to protect the drug against inactivation, allowing controlled release and also passive accumulation in tumor tissues by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Furthermore, ANCs undergo active targeting through EGFR receptor-mediated endocytosis, leading to the formation of lysosomes and drug release into the cytosol. Herein, we will present and discuss some important aspects regarding EGFR structure, its role on internal signaling pathways and downregulation aspects. Then, considering that EGFR is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy, the monoclonal antibodies able to target this receptor will be presented and discussed. Finally, ADCs and ANCs state of the art will be reviewed and recent studies and clinical progresses will be highlighted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper to address specifically the EGFR target and its application on ADCs and ANCs.",*Antineoplastic Agents ErbB Receptors *Immunoconjugates *Nanoparticles *Neoplasms/drug therapy *Pharmaceutical Preparations

The article reviews the current status on the innovation of the Mexican pharmaceutical industry with a focus on cancer drugs. The authors examined the scientific and nonscientific literature in search of the origin of innovative cancer drugs, as well as the regulatory frames by which these drugs are approved in Mexico. The article presents a narrative analysis of the author's experiences on the barriers that impede pharmaceutical innovation in Mexico. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there was only 1 domestic approval by COFEPRIS, the Mexican health regulatory agency, of an anticancer product developed under a repositioning approach. Among the barriers impeding drug innovation in Mexico are, but not be limited to, insufficient funds for the discovery phase; unaffordable or limited capacity for performing preclinical studies under good laboratory practices (GLP); lengthy clinical trial approval; unfavorable conditions for clinical trials for both academic and domestic pharmaceutical industry-sponsored studies; unclear policies for drug approvals and marketing. The authors state specific proposals for overcoming these barriers to generate a climate for increasing participation of academic and existing domestic pharmaceutical industry as well as to increase venture capital and favor start-up and early-stage companies. In conclusion, Mexico has the human resources and material infrastructure to innovate.

34517536,Strategies for the treatment of breast cancer: from classical drugs to mathematical models.,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and generally affects women. It is a heterogeneous disease that presents different entities, different biological characteristics, and differentiated clinical behaviors. With this in mind, this literature review had as its main objective to analyze the path taken from the simple use of classical drugs to the application of mathematical models, which through the many ongoing studies, have been considered as one of the reliable strategies, explaining the reasons why chemotherapy is not always successful. Besides, the most commonly mentioned strategies are immunotherapy, which includes techniques and therapies such as the use of antibodies, cytokines, antitumor vaccines, oncolytic and genomic viruses, among others, and nanoparticles, including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, liposome, dendrimer, micelle, and others, as well as drug reuse, which is a process by which new therapeutic indications are found for existing and approved drugs. The most commonly used pharmacological categories are cardiac, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, antiviral, antibiotic, and others. For the efficient development of reused drugs, there must be a process of exchange of purposes, methods, and information already available, and for their better understanding, computational mathematical models are then used, of which the methods of blind search or screening, based on the target, knowledge, signature, pathway or network and the mechanism to which it is directed, stand out. To conclude it should be noted that these different strategies can be applied alone or in combination with each other always to improve breast cancer treatment.","*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy Female Humans Immunotherapy Models, Theoretical *Pharmaceutical Preparations"
34352380,Mechanism of Drug Tolerant Persister Cancer Cells: The Landscape and Clinical Implication for Therapy.,"A minor population of cancer cells may evade cell death from chemotherapy and targeted therapy by entering a reversible slow proliferation state known as the drug tolerant persister (DTP) state. This DTP state can allow cancer cells to survive drug therapy long enough for additional mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to develop. Thus, cancer persistence is a major obstacle to curing cancers, where insight into the biology of DTP cells and therapeutic strategies targeting this mechanism can have considerable clinical implications. There is emerging evidence that DTP cells adapt to new environments through epigenomic modification, transcriptomic regulation, flexible energy metabolism, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we review and discuss the various proposed mechanisms of cancer persister cells and the molecular features underlying the DTP state, with insights into the potential therapeutic strategies to conquer DTP cells and prevent cancer recurrence or therapeutic failures.","Humans *Lung Neoplasms Neoplasm Recurrence, Local *Pharmaceutical Preparations Tumor Microenvironment"
34036903,Developing Novel Drug Candidates and Repurposed Drugs for Prostate Cancer Based on Molecular Profiles.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) carries a growing burden on society. Lack of curative treatment and poor prognosis among patients with advanced PCa imply an urgent need for novel and improved drug identification. This is hampered by the disease's high molecular heterogeneity and complex molecular pathophysiology, resulting in drugs being efficient in a few patients and cancer developing resistance to treatment. De novo drug discovery has proven to be complex and challenging. Along with technological advancements (mainly linked to -omics approaches) that allow for comprehensive characterization of the molecular changes underlying disease, and considering respective developments in bioinformatics, computational drug repurposing has emerged as a promising approach to shorten the way from discovery to clinical application and address the disease molecular complexity. With this article, we aimed at reviewing recent studies in which drugs/ compounds for PCa were defined through the investigation of molecular profiling (-omics) data and the application of drug repurposing strategies. A brief overview of the technical requirements and associated challenges with the latter are also provided. For that purpose, a literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. Numerous drugs/ compounds have been proposed as potential PCa therapeutics, mostly based on the investigation of genomics and transcriptomics data. In most cases, further assessment in disease models is required. Since ultimately proteins are targeted by drugs, expanding on the use of proteomics profiling data (alone or in combination with other -omics) is expected to advance further defining new/repurposed drugs for PCa.",Computational Biology Drug Repositioning Genomics Humans Male *Pharmaceutical Preparations *Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics
34991982,An update on drugs with therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century with more than 257 million cases and over 5.17 million deaths reported worldwide (as of November 23, 2021. Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved. Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVIDâ„¢ (PF-07321332). Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVIDâ„¢ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint). However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases. Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic. In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVIDâ„¢ summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses. Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity. The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.","Adult Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use *COVID-19/therapy Humans Immunization, Passive Lactams Leucine Nitriles Pandemics *Pharmaceutical Preparations Proline Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic SARS-CoV-2 Treatment Outcome"

Although unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS. In this article, we first provided an overview of COVID-19 etiology vis-Ã -vis other zoonotic diseases, particularly SARS and MERS. Then, we summarized the characteristics of droplets/aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and how they aid in the transmission of the virus among people. Moreover, we discussed the molecular mechanisms that enable SARS-CoV-2 to access the host and become more contagious than other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.

As of today, there are three U.S Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Also, the antiviral drug remdesivir and two combinations of monoclonal antibodies are authorized for Emergency use (EUA) in certain patients. Furthermore, baricitinib was approved in Japan (April 23, 2021). Despite available vaccines and EUA, pharmacological therapy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is still highly required. There are several ongoing clinical trials investigating the efficacy of clinically available drugs in treating COVID-19. In this study, selected novel pharmacological agents for the possible treatment of COVID-19 will be discussed. Point of discussion will cover mechanism of action, supporting evidence for safety and efficacy and reached stage in development. Drugs were classified into three classes according to the phase of viral life cycle they target. Phase I, the early infective phase, relies on supportive care and symptomatic treatment as needed. In phase II, the pulmonary phase, treatment aims at inhibiting viral entry or replication. Drugs used during this phase are famotidine, monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, ivermectin, remdesivir, camostat mesylate and other antiviral agents. Finally, phase III, the hyper-inflammatory phase, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and melatonin are used.

29076109,A Review of Food-Drug Interactions on Oral Drug Absorption.,"Food effect, also known as food-drug interactions, is a common phenomenon associated with orally administered medications and can be defined as changes in absorption rate or absorption extent. The mechanisms of food effect and their consequences can involve multiple factors, including human post-prandial physiology, properties of the drug, and how the drug is administered. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these mechanisms when recommending whether a specific drug should be taken with or without food. Food-drug interactions can be clinically relevant, especially when they must be avoided to prevent undesirable effects or exploited to optimize medication therapy. This review conducts a literature search that examined studies on food effect. We summarized the literature and identified and discussed common food effect mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlighted drugs that have a clinically significant food effect and discussed the corresponding mechanisms. In addition, this review analyzes the effects of high-fat food or standard meals on the oral drug absorption rate and absorption extent for 229 drugs based on the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System and demonstrates an association between Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System class and food effect.","Administration, Oral Biopharmaceutics Food-Drug Interactions/*physiology *Gastric Absorption Humans *Oral Mucosal Absorption Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism"

Literature was identified by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science till December 30 2017. Among 46 finally included RCTs, six RCTs simply addressed pharmacodynamic interactions and 33 RCTs studied pharmacokinetic interactions, whereas seven RCTs investigated both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Twenty-two juice-drug combinations showed potential clinical relevance. The beneficial combinations included orange juice-ferrous fumarate, lemon juice-(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin, pomegranate juice-intravenous iron during hemodialysis, cranberry juice-triple therapy medications for H. pylori, blueberry juice-etanercept, lime juice-antimalarials, and wheat grass juice-chemotherapy. The potential adverse interactions included decreased drug bioavailability (apple juice-fexofenadine, atenolol, aliskiren; orange juice-aliskiren, atenolol, celiprolol, montelukast, fluoroquinolones, alendronate; pomelo juice-sildenafil; grape juice-cyclosporine), increased bioavailability (Seville orange juice-felodipine, pomelo juice-cyclosporine, orange-aluminum containing antacids). Unlike furanocoumarin-rich grapefruit juice which could primarily precipitate drug interactions by strong inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein and thus cause deadly outcomes due to co-ingestion with some medications, other fruit juices did not precipitate severely detrimental food-drug interaction despite of sporadic case reports. The extent of a juice-drug interaction may be associated with volume of drinking juice, fruit varieties, type of fruit, time between juice drinking and drug intake, genetic polymorphism in the enzymes or transporters and anthropometric variables. Pharmacists and health professionals should properly screen for and educate patients about potential adverse juice-drug interactions and help minimize their occurrence. Much attention should be paid to adolescents and the elderly who ingest medications with drinking fruit juices or consume fresh fruits during drug treatment.

28196633,"Old and new oral anticoagulants: Food, herbal medicines and drug interactions.","The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter medications.","Animals Anticoagulants/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use *Drug Interactions Food-Drug Interactions Herbal Medicine/methods Humans Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use Plants, Medicinal/chemistry Vitamin K/antagonists & inhibitors"
30974173,The mechanisms of pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions - A perspective from the UNGAP group.,"The simultaneous intake of food and drugs can have a strong impact on drug release, absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination and consequently, on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy. As such, food-drug interactions are one of the main challenges in oral drug administration. Whereas pharmacokinetic (PK) food-drug interactions can have a variety of causes, pharmacodynamic (PD) food-drug interactions occur due to specific pharmacological interactions between a drug and particular drinks or food. In recent years, extensive efforts were made to elucidate the mechanisms that drive pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions. Their occurrence depends mainly on the properties of the drug substance, the formulation and a multitude of physiological factors. Every intake of food or drink changes the physiological conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a precise understanding of how different foods and drinks affect the processes of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination as well as formulation performance is important in order to be able to predict and avoid such interactions. Furthermore, it must be considered that beverages such as milk, grapefruit juice and alcohol can also lead to specific food-drug interactions. In this regard, the growing use of food supplements and functional food requires urgent attention in oral pharmacotherapy. Recently, a new consortium in Understanding Gastrointestinal Absorption-related Processes (UNGAP) was established through COST, a funding organisation of the European Union supporting translational research across Europe. In this review of the UNGAP Working group ""Food-Drug Interface"", the different mechanisms that can lead to pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions are discussed and summarised from different expert perspectives.","Administration, Oral Biological Availability Drug Liberation/*physiology Europe Food-Drug Interactions/*physiology Gastrointestinal Absorption/physiology Gastrointestinal Tract/*physiology Humans Intestinal Absorption Pharmacokinetics"

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and IPA abstracts to locate relevant articles published between January 1982 and July 2017. DAILYMED was used to identify manufacturer-specific medication administration recommendations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed for inclusion based on their relevance to this subject matter and the integrity of the information provided. Additionally, the package labeling of included products was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current recommendations for specific medication administration with regard to food are summarized descriptively. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant food-drug interactions are common and have been reported with multiple classes of medications. However, there are a limited number of studies examining food-drug interactions, and the majority of recommendations are made by product-specific manufacturers. Pharmacists should be aware of common food-drug interactions in the community, assisted living, long-term care, subacute care, and hospital settings. To optimize medication therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes, it is important for pharmacists and other health care providers to identify agents with potential for food-drug interactions and to understand the clinical relevance of such interactions.","Aged Aged, 80 and over Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Enteral Nutrition *Food-Drug Interactions Humans Medication Therapy Management Pharmacists"
34445237,The Clinical Significance of Drug-Food Interactions of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Patients treated with anticoagulants should avoid products containing St. John's wort and take special care with other food ingredients. As the interest in dietary supplements is on the rise, healthcare providers can contribute to the development of well-designed clinical trials on interactions between DOACs and food, and distribute sufficient knowledge about the proper use of these supplements among patients.","Administration, Oral *Anticoagulants/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use *Dietary Supplements *Food-Drug Interactions Humans *Vitamin K/antagonists & inhibitors/blood"

It plays an important role in modulating allergy reactions and immune system responses. H1 receptor is a therapeutic target for drugs applied in allergic diseases such as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, urticarial, or atopic dermatitis. H1-antihistamines display different chemical structures, pharmacokinetics and a potential for drug-drug and drug-food interactions. Drug-food interactions are known to reduce therapeutic effects of the medicine, as well as to induce a potent adverse drug reactions. Considering it all, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the importance of drug-food interaction for H1-antihistamine drugs. As non-sedating second generation H1-antihistamines remain to be drugs of choice in treating allergic conditions, the review has been focused on this particular class of medicines. The aim of this paper is to examine the evidence of food-drug and food-alcohol interactions for second generation H1-antihistamine drugs. A systematic literature queries were performed in the following databases: Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science (all from their inception date till October 2016). The queries covered nine specific names of second generation anthistamine drugs, namely bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, and rupatadine, in combinations with such terms as ""food"", ""juice"", ""grapefruit"", ""fruits"", ""alcohol"", ""pharmacokinetics"", and ""meal"". Additional publications were found by checking all the reference lists. Where none data on drug-food interaction could be found within the investigated databases, a specific drug prescribing information was used. 2326 publications were identified with the database queries. Articles were subjected to analysis by reviewing their title, abstract and full text; duplicated papers were removed. Having collected a complete set of data, a critical review was undertaken. For selected H1-antihistamines food, fruit juices or alcohol consumption may significantly impact the efficacy and safety of the therapy.

29232282,Selected Food/Herb-Drug Interactions: Mechanisms and Clinical Relevance.,"BACKGROUND: Food/Herb-drug interactions have become a major problem in health care. These interactions can lead to loss of therapeutic efficacy or toxic effects of drugs. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: To probe the clinical relevance of such interactions, the impact of food/herb intake on the clinical effects of drug administration has to be evaluated. Failure to identify and efficiently manage food-drug interactions can lead to serious consequences. A comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms that underpin variability in disposition will help optimize therapy. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of literatures from relevant databases were conducted. A total of 58 original scientific reports/review articles were obtained with the search strategy; of which 25 were found eligible to be included in the present review. Required data were extracted from these studies, and their methodologies were assessed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This review updates our knowledge on clinical food-drug interactions with emphasis on mechanism and clinical implications. Results obtained from literature search identified interactions with selected foods/herbs generated from in vivo and in vitro studies. For example, interaction studies in humans revealed a reduction in the bioavailability of mercaptopurine when taken concurrently with substances containing xanthine oxidase (eg, cow milk); a reduction in the bioavailability of quinine with Garcinia kola; increased bioavailability/toxicity of felodipine, nifedipine, saquinavir, sildenafil with grape juice; increased bioavailability of felodipine, cisapride with red wine and diminished bioavailability of fexofenadine with apple. Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms are implicated in many of these interactions. By evaluating the dietary patterns of patients and use of prescribed medications, health professionals will be well informed of potential interactions and associated adverse effects.",*Biological Availability Dietary Supplements Drug Therapy/*methods *Eating *Food-Drug Interactions *Herb-Drug Interactions Humans Nutritional Status
27914234,"Food, gastrointestinal pH, and models of oral drug absorption.","This article reviews the major physiological and physicochemical principles of the effect of food and gastrointestinal (GI) pH on the absorption and bioavailability of oral drugs, and the various absorption models that are used to describe/predict oral drug absorption. The rate and extent of oral drug absorption is determined by a complex interaction between a drug's physicochemical properties, GI physiologic factors, and the nature of the formulation administered. GI pH is an important factor that can markedly affect oral drug absorption and bioavailability as it may have significant influence on drug dissolution & solubility, drug release, drug stability, and intestinal permeability. Different regions of the GI tract have different drug absorptive properties. Thus, the transit time in each GI region and its variability between subjects may contribute to the variability in the rate and/or extent of drug absorption. Food-drug interactions can result in delayed, decreased, increased, and sometimes un-altered drug absorption. Food effects on oral absorption can be achieved by direct and indirect mechanisms. Various models have been proposed to describe oral absorption ranging from empirical models to the more sophisticated ""mechanism-based"" models. Through understanding of the physicochemical and physiological rate-limiting factors affecting oral absorption, modellers can implement simplified population-based modelling approaches that are less complex than whole-body physiologically-based models but still capture the essential elements in a physiological way and hence will be more suited for population modelling of large clinical data sets. It will also help formulation scientists to better predict formulation performance and to develop formulations that maximize oral bioavailability.","Administration, Oral Aged Biological Availability *Food-Drug Interactions Gastrointestinal Tract/*metabolism Humans *Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Pharmacokinetics Solubility"
31571167,Transporter-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions and Their Significance.,"Drug transporters are considered to be determinants of drug disposition and effects/toxicities by affecting the absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs. Drug transporters are generally divided into solute carrier (SLC) family and ATP binding cassette (ABC) family. Widely studied ABC family transporters include P-glycoprotein (P-GP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs). SLC family transporters related to drug transport mainly include organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), organic anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters (OCTs), organic cation/carnitine transporters (OCTNs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and multidrug/toxin extrusions (MATEs). These transporters are often expressed in tissues related to drug disposition, such as the small intestine, liver, and kidney, implicating intestinal absorption of drugs, uptake of drugs into hepatocytes, and renal/bile excretion of drugs. Most of therapeutic drugs are their substrates or inhibitors. When they are comedicated, serious drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may occur due to alterations in intestinal absorption, hepatic uptake, or renal/bile secretion of drugs, leading to enhancement of their activities or toxicities or therapeutic failure. This chapter will illustrate transporter-mediated DDIs (including food drug interaction) in human and their clinical significances.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/metabolism *ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism Biological Transport *Drug Interactions Food-Drug Interactions Humans Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism Organic Anion Transporters *Pharmaceutical Preparations/metabolism"

The evolution of gene regulation and expression within and between species is thought to frequently contribute to adaptation. Yet considerable evidence suggests that the primary evolutionary force acting on variation in gene expression is stabilizing selection. We review here the results of recent studies characterizing the evolution of gene expression occurring in cis (via linked polymorphisms) or in trans (through diffusible products of other genes) and their contribution to adaptation and response to the environment. We review the evidence for buffering of variation in gene expression at the level of both transcription and translation, and the possible mechanisms for this buffering.

A typical question that is posed in such studies is finding genes with significant changes between sample groups. In this respect expression variability is regarded as a nuisance factor that is primarily of technical origin and complicates the data analysis. However, it is becoming apparent that the biological variation in gene expression might be an important molecular phenotype that can affect physiological parameters. In this review we explore the recent literature on technical and biological variability in gene expression, sources of expression variability, (epi-)genetic hallmarks, and evolutionary constraints in genes with robust and variable gene expression. We provide an overview of recent findings on effects of external cues, such as diet and aging, on expression variability and on other biological phenomena that can be linked to it. We discuss metrics and tools that were developed for quantification of expression variability and highlight the importance of future studies in this direction. To assist the adoption of expression variability analysis, we also provide a detailed description and computer code, which can easily be utilized by other researchers.

We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN and to characterize their circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns. We identified eight major cell types, with each type displaying a specific pattern of circadian gene expression. Five SCN neuronal subtypes, each with specific combinations of markers, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light responsiveness. Through a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse SCN at single-cell resolution, we obtained a standardized SCN atlas containing the spatial distribution of these subtypes and gene expression. Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous circadian gene expression between SCN neuron subtypes. Such a spatiotemporal pattern of gene regulation within the SCN may have an important function in the circadian pacemaker.","Animals Atlases as Topic Circadian Rhythm/physiology Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics Gene Expression/*physiology/radiation effects Gene Expression Regulation/physiology Genomics Light Male Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Neurons/classification/*physiology Photic Stimulation *Single-Cell Analysis Suprachiasmatic Nucleus/anatomy & histology/cytology/*physiology"

To understand the relationship between these two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals, we describe the useÂ of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed ""noise"" in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue. We derive a mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription, chromosome structure, and the cell's ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that hypervariability is largely dynamic and does not reflect a stable biological state.","Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism Estrogens Gene Expression/genetics/*physiology Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology Humans Models, Theoretical Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology RNA, Messenger/metabolism Single-Cell Analysis/methods Transcription, Genetic/genetics/*physiology Transcriptional Activation/physiology Trefoil Factor-1/genetics"

Although transcription factor-based systems are widely used, they are not well suited for certain applications due to a lack of functionality, limited available coding space, and potential immunogenicity of the regulatory proteins. RNA-based switches fill this gap since they can be designed to respond to effector compounds utilizing ligand-sensing aptamers. These systems are very modular since the aptamer can be combined with a variety of different expression platforms.

32580376,Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine.,"Pharmacogenomics is one of the emerging approaches to precision medicine, tailoring drug selection and dosing to the patient's genetic features. In recent years, several pharmacogenetic guidelines have been published by international scientific consortia, but the uptake in clinical practice is still poor. Many coordinated international efforts are ongoing in order to overcome the existing barriers to pharmacogenomic implementation. On the other hand, existing validated pharmacogenomic markers can explain only a minor part of the observed clinical variability in the therapeutic outcome. New investigational approaches are warranted, including the study of the pharmacogenomic role of the immune system genetics and of previously neglected rare genetic variants, reported to account for a large part of the inter-individual variability in drug metabolism. In this Special Issue, we collected a series of articles covering many aspects of pharmacogenomics. These include clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, development of tools or infrastractures to support this process, research of new pharmacogenomics markers to increase drug efficacy and safety, and the impact of rare genetic variants in pharmacogenomics.",*Biomarkers Humans *Pharmacogenetics Pharmacogenomic Testing *Precision Medicine
28582322,Atopic dermatitis phenotypes and the need for personalized medicine.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent developments in therapies which target the molecular mechanisms in atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Current advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of atopic dermatitis are leading to the stratification of different atopic dermatitis phenotypes. New therapies offer the option to target-specific molecules involved in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. Current new therapies under investigation aim to modulate specific inflammatory pathways associated with distinctive atopic dermatitis phenotypes, which would potentially translate into the development of personalized, targeted-specific treatments of atopic dermatitis. SUMMARY: Despite the unmet need for well tolerated, effective, and personalized treatment of atopic dermatitis, the current standard treatments of atopic dermatitis do not focus on the individual pathogenesis of the disease. The development of targeted, phenotype-specific therapies has the potential to open a new promising era of individualized treatment of atopic dermatitis.","Biomarkers/metabolism Dermatitis, Atopic/*diagnosis/*metabolism/*therapy Humans Precision Medicine/*methods/trends"
28282715,Personalized Regenerative Medicine.,"Personalized medicine as a novel field of medicine refers to the prescription of specific therapeutics procedure for an individual. This approach has established based on pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic information and data. The terms precision and personalized medicines are sometimes applied interchangeably. However, there has been a shift from ""personalized medicine"" towards ""precision medicine"". Although personalized medicine emerged from pharmacogenetics, nowadays it covers many fields of healthcare. Accordingly, regenerative medicine and cellular therapy as the new fields of medicine use cell-based products in order to develop personalized treatments. Different sources of stem cells including mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been considered in targeted therapies which could give many advantages. iPSCs as the novel and individual pluripotent stem cells have been introduced as the appropriate candidates for personalized cell therapies. Cellular therapies can provide a personalized approach. Because of person-to-person and population differences in the result of stem cell therapy, individualized cellular therapy must be adjusted according to the patient specific profile, in order to achieve best therapeutic results and outcomes. Several factors should be considered to achieve personalized stem cells therapy such as, recipient factors, donor factors, and the overall body environment in which the stem cells could be active and functional. In addition to these factors, the source of stem cells must be carefully chosen based on functional and physical criteria that lead to optimal outcomes.",*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy Embryonic Stem Cells Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Mesenchymal Stem Cells *Precision Medicine *Regenerative Medicine Stem Cell Transplantation

28212749,Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions. However, systematic comparisons of the performance of diverse scRNA-seq protocols are lacking. We generated data from 583 mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate six prominent scRNA-seq methods: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq, and Smart-seq2. While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.","Animals Base Sequence Cell Line Computer Simulation Cost-Benefit Analysis Embryonic Stem Cells/*chemistry *High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/economics Mice Models, Economic RNA/*genetics/isolation & purification Sequence Analysis, RNA/economics/*methods Single-Cell Analysis/economics/*methods"

Since its introduction, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have revolutionized the genomics field as they created unprecedented opportunities for resolving cell heterogeneity by exploring gene expression profiles at a single-cell resolution. However, the rapidly evolving field of scRNA-seq invoked the emergence of various analytics approaches aimed to maximize the full potential of this novel strategy. Unlike population-based RNA sequencing approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated challenges. Despite the vast number of analytical methods, a universal standardization is lacking. While this reflects the fields' immaturity, it may also encumber a newcomer to blend in.In this review, we aim to bridge over the abovementioned hurdle and propose four ready-to-use pipelines for scRNA-seq analysis easily accessible by a newcomer, that could fit various biological data types. Here we provide an overview of the currently available single-cell technologies for cell isolation and library preparation and a step by step guide that covers the entire canonical analytic workflow to analyse scRNA-seq data including read mapping, quality controls, gene expression quantification, normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cell clustering useful for trajectory inference and differential expression. Such workflow guidelines will escort novices as well as expert users in the analysis of complex scRNA-seq datasets, thus further expanding the research potential of single-cell approaches in basic science, and envisaging its future implementation as best practice in the field.","*Algorithms Animals Cluster Analysis Gene Expression Profiling/methods/statistics & numerical data Genomics/methods High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods/statistics & numerical data Humans Quality Control Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods/statistics & numerical data Single-Cell Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data Software Transcriptome"

The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically performed in ""bulk,"" and the data represent an average of gene expression patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project.

31501885,BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining.,"MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. RESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

31557052,Generating the Blood Exposome Database Using a Comprehensive Text Mining and Database Fusion Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 compounds to blood-related primary publications. CONCLUSION: This new Blood Exposome Database can be used for prioritizing chemicals for systematic reviews, developing target assays in exposome research, identifying compounds in untargeted mass spectrometry, and biological interpretation in metabolomics data.

At the early stage of OA, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the first-line treatment. However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies are limited. We aim to use bioinformatics to identify potential genes and drugs associated with OA. METHODS: The genes related to OA and NSAIDs therapy were determined by text mining. Then, the common genes were performed for GO, KEGG pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Using the MCODE plugin-obtained hub genes, the expression levels of hub genes were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The confirmed genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database to determine potential genes and drugs. RESULTS: The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression level of 15 genes was significantly increased in OA samples. Finally, eight potential genes were targetable to a total of 53 drugs, twenty-one of which have been employed to treat OA and 32 drugs have not yet been used in OA. CONCLUSIONS: The 15 genes (including PTGS2, NLRP3, MMP9, IL1RN, CCL2, TNF, IL10, CD40, IL6, NGF, TP53, RELA, BCL2L1, VEGFA, and NOTCH1) and 32 drugs, which have not been used in OA but approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be potential genes and drugs, respectively, to improve OA treatment.

30937439,Open Agile text mining for bioinformatics: the PubAnnotation ecosystem.,"MOTIVATION: Most currently available text mining tools share two characteristics that make them less than optimal for use by biomedical researchers: they require extensive specialist skills in natural language processing and they were built on the assumption that they should optimize global performance metrics on representative datasets. This is a problem because most end-users are not natural language processing specialists and because biomedical researchers often care less about global metrics like F-measure or representative datasets than they do about more granular metrics such as precision and recall on their own specialized datasets. Thus, there are fundamental mismatches between the assumptions of much text mining work and the preferences of potential end-users. RESULTS: This article introduces the concept of Agile text mining, and presents the PubAnnotation ecosystem as an example implementation. The system approaches the problems from two perspectives: it allows the reformulation of text mining by biomedical researchers from the task of assembling a complete system to the task of retrieving warehoused annotations, and it makes it possible to do very targeted customization of the pre-existing system to address specific end-user requirements. Two use cases are presented: assisted curation of the GlycoEpitope database, and assessing coverage in the literature of pre-eclampsia-associated genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The three tools that make up the ecosystem, PubAnnotation, PubDictionaries and TextAE are publicly available as web services, and also as open source projects.

Lastly, we touch on the topics of how TGx approaches could facilitate adverse outcome pathways (AOP) development and enhance read-across strategies to further regulatory application. Finally, we summarize current efforts to develop TGx for risk assessment and set out remaining challenges.",Animal Testing Alternatives Animals Humans Machine Learning Reproducibility of Results Risk Assessment/methods Toxicogenetics/*methods/trends
33068428,Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): update 2021.,"The public Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) is an innovative digital ecosystem that relates toxicological information for chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and exposures to advance understanding about human health. Literature-based, manually curated interactions are integrated to create a knowledgebase that harmonizes cross-species heterogeneous data for chemical exposures and their biological repercussions. In this biennial update, we report a 20% increase in CTD curated content and now provide 45 million toxicogenomic relationships for over 16 300 chemicals, 51 300 genes, 5500 phenotypes, 7200 diseases and 163 000 exposure events, from 600 comparative species. Furthermore, we increase the functionality of chemical-phenotype content with new data-tabs on CTD Disease pages (to help fill in knowledge gaps for environmental health) and new phenotype search parameters (for Batch Query and Venn analysis tools). As well, we introduce new CTD Anatomy pages that allow users to uniquely explore and analyze chemical-phenotype interactions from an anatomical perspective. Finally, we have enhanced CTD Chemical pages with new literature-based chemical synonyms (to improve querying) and added 1600 amino acid-based compounds (to increase chemical landscape). Together, these updates continue to augment CTD as a powerful resource for generating testable hypotheses about the etiologies and molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.","Databases, Chemical *Databases, Factual Databases, Genetic *Gene-Environment Interaction Genome, Human/*drug effects Genomics/*methods Genotype Humans Internet Knowledge Bases Organ Specificity Phenotype Prescription Drugs/chemistry/*pharmacology Software Toxicogenetics/methods Xenobiotics/chemistry/*toxicity"
27864593,Toxicogenomics in Environmental Science.,"This chapter reviews the current knowledge and recent progress in the field of environmental, aquatic ecotoxicogenomics with a focus on transcriptomic methods. In ecotoxicogenomics the omics technologies are applied for the detection and assessment of adverse effects in the environment, and thus are to be distinguished from omics used in human toxicology [Snape et al., Aquat Toxicol 67:143-154, 2004]. Transcriptomic methods in ecotoxicology are applied to gain a mechanistic understanding of toxic effects on organisms or populations, and thus aim to bridge the gap between cause and effect. A worthwhile effect-based interpretation of stressor induced changes on the transcriptome is based on the principle of phenotypic-anchoring [Paules, Environ Health Perspect 111:A338-A339, 2003]. Thereby, changes on the transcriptomic level can only be identified as effects if they are clearly linked to a specific stressor-induced effect on the macroscopic level. By integrating those macroscopic and transcriptomic effects, conclusions on the effect-inducing type of the stressor can be drawn. Stressor-specific effects on the transcriptomic level can be identified as stressor-specific induced pathways, transcriptomic patterns, or stressors-specific genetic biomarkers. In this chapter, examples of the combined application of macroscopic and transcriptional effects for the identification of environmental stressors, such as aquatic pollutants, are given and discussed. By means of these examples, challenges on the way to a standardized application of transcriptomics in ecotoxicology are discussed. This is also done against the background of the application of transcriptomic methods in environmental regulation such as the EU regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).",Animals Biological Assay/methods/trends Ecology/methods/trends Ecotoxicology/methods/trends Environmental Monitoring/*methods Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/trends High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods/trends Humans Mutagenicity Tests/*methods/trends Mutagens/toxicity Risk Assessment/methods/trends Toxicogenetics/*methods/trends Transcriptome/drug effects/genetics
29453537,Toxicogenomics: A New Paradigm for Nanotoxicity Evaluation.,"The wider applications of nanoparticles (NPs) has evoked a world-wide concern due to their possible risk of toxicity in humans and other organisms. AggregationÂ and accumulation of NPs into cell leads to their interaction with biological macromolecules including proteins, nucleic acids and cellular organelles, which eventually induceÂ toxicological effects. Application of toxicogenomics to investigate molecular pathway-basedÂ toxicological consequences has opened new vistas in nanotoxicologyÂ research. Indeed, genomic approachesÂ appeared as a new paradigm in terms of providing information at molecular levels and have been proven to be as a powerful tool for identification and quantification of global shifts in gene expression. ToxicologicalÂ responses of NPs have been discussed in this chapter with the aim to provide a clear understanding of the molecular mechanism of NPs induced toxicity both in in vivo and in vitro test models.",Animals *Gene Expression Regulation Humans Nanoparticles/*toxicity Toxicogenetics/*methods

32276469,"Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics, Part III: Data Modelling for Risk Assessment.","Transcriptomics data are relevant to address a number of challenges in Toxicogenomics (TGx). After careful planning of exposure conditions and data preprocessing, the TGx data can be used in predictive toxicology, where more advanced modelling techniques are applied. The large volume of molecular profiles produced by omics-based technologies allows the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in TGx. Indeed, the publicly available omics datasets are constantly increasing together with a plethora of different methods that are made available to facilitate their analysis, interpretation and the generation of accurate and stable predictive models. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art of data modelling applied to transcriptomics data in TGx. We show how the benchmark dose (BMD) analysis can be applied to TGx data. We review read across and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) modelling methodologies. We discuss how network-based approaches can be successfully employed to clarify the mechanism of action (MOA) or specific biomarkers of exposure. We also describe the main AI methodologies applied to TGx data to create predictive classification and regression models and we address current challenges. Finally, we present a short description of deep learning (DL) and data integration methodologies applied in these contexts. Modelling of TGx data represents a valuable tool for more accurate chemical safety assessment. This review is the third part of a three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.",
32087008,"The promise of toxicogenomics for genetic toxicology: past, present and future.","Toxicogenomics, the application of genomics to toxicology, was described as 'a new era' for toxicology. Standard toxicity tests typically involve a number of short-term bioassays that are costly, time consuming, require large numbers of animals and generally focus on a single end point. Toxicogenomics was heralded as a way to improve the efficiency of toxicity testing by assessing gene regulation across the genome, allowing rapid classification of compounds based on characteristic expression profiles. Gene expression microarrays could measure and characterise genome-wide gene expression changes in a single study and while transcriptomic profiles that can discriminate between genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens have been identified, challenges with the approach limited its application. As such, toxicogenomics did not transform the field of genetic toxicology in the way it was predicted. More recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionised genomics owing to the fact that hundreds of billions of base pairs can be sequenced simultaneously cheaper and quicker than traditional Sanger methods. In relation to genetic toxicology, and thousands of cancer genomes have been sequenced with single-base substitution mutational signatures identified, and mutation signatures have been identified following treatment of cells with known or suspected environmental carcinogens. RNAseq has been applied to detect transcriptional changes following treatment with genotoxins; modified RNAseq protocols have been developed to identify adducts in the genome and Duplex sequencing is an example of a technique that has recently been developed to accurately detect mutation. Machine learning, including MutationSeq and SomaticSeq, has also been applied to somatic mutation detection and improvements in automation and/or the application of machine learning algorithms may allow high-throughput mutation sequencing in the future. This review will discuss the initial promise of transcriptomics for genetic toxicology, and how the development of NGS technologies and new machine learning algorithms may finally realise that promise.",Algorithms Gene Expression Regulation/genetics Genomics/*trends High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*trends Humans Machine Learning Mutagens/metabolism Mutation Toxicogenetics/*trends Toxicology/*trends
35881918,Advances in Single-Cell Toxicogenomics in Environmental Toxicology.,"The toxicity evaluation system of environmental pollutants has undergone numerous changes due to the application of new technologies. Single-cell toxicogenomics is rapidly changing our view on environmental toxicology by increasing the resolution of our analysis to the level of a single cell. Applications of this technology in environmental toxicology have begun to emerge and are rapidly expanding the portfolio of existing technologies and applications. Here, we first summarized different methods involved in single-cell isolation and amplification in single-cell sequencing process, compared the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, and analyzed their development trends. Then, we reviewed the main advances of single-cell toxicogenomics in environmental toxicology, emphatically analyzed the application prospects of this technology in identifying the target cells of pollutants in early embryos, clarifying the heterogeneous response of cell subtypes to pollutants, and finding pathogenic bacteria in unknown microbes, and highlighted the unique characteristics of this approach with high resolution, high throughput, and high specificity by examples. We also offered a prediction of the further application of this technology and the revolution it brings in environmental toxicology. Overall, these advances will provide practical solutions for controlling or mitigating exogenous toxicological effects that threaten human and ecosystem health, contribute to improving our understanding of the physiological processes affected by pollutants, and lead to the emergence of new methods of pollution control.",Ecosystem Ecotoxicology *Environmental Pollutants/toxicity Humans Toxicogenetics *Toxicology/methods
30909101,Toxicogenomics - What added Value Do These Approaches Provide for Carcinogen Risk Assessment?,"It is still a major challenge to protect humans at workplaces and in the environment. To cope with this task, it is a prerequisite to obtain detailed information on the extent of chemical perturbations of biological pathways, in particular, adaptive vs. adverse effects and the dose-response relationships. This knowledge serves as the basis for the classification of non-carcinogens and carcinogens and for further distinguishing carcinogens in genotoxic (DNA damaging) or non-genotoxic compounds. Basing on quantitative dose-response relationships, points of departures can be derived for chemical risk assessment. In recent years, new methods have shown their capability to support the established rodent models of carcinogenicity testing. In vitro high throughput screening assays assess more comprehensively cell response. In addition, omics technologies were applied to study the mode of action of chemicals whereby the term ""toxicogenomics"" comprises various technologies such as transcriptomics, epigenomics, or metabolomics. This review aims to summarize the current state of toxicogenomic approaches in risk science and to compare them with established ones. For example, measurement of global transcriptional changes generates meaningful information for toxicological risk assessment such as accurate classification of genotoxic/non-genotoxic carcinogens. Alteration in mRNA expression offers previously unknown insights in the mode of action and enables the definition of key events. Based on these, benchmark doses can be calculated for the transition from an adaptive to an adverse state. In short, this review assesses the potential and challenges of transcriptomics and addresses the impact of other omics technologies on risk assessment in terms of hazard identification and dose-response assessment.","Carcinogenicity Tests *Carcinogens Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Risk Assessment *Toxicogenetics"
32397130,"Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics, Part II: Preprocessing and Differential Expression Analysis for High Quality Data.","Preprocessing of transcriptomics data plays a pivotal role in the development of toxicogenomics-driven tools for chemical toxicity assessment. The generation and exploitation of large volumes of molecular profiles, following an appropriate experimental design, allows the employment of toxicogenomics (TGx) approaches for a thorough characterisation of the mechanism of action (MOA) of different compounds. To date, a plethora of data preprocessing methodologies have been suggested. However, in most cases, building the optimal analytical workflow is not straightforward. A careful selection of the right tools must be carried out, since it will affect the downstream analyses and modelling approaches. Transcriptomics data preprocessing spans across multiple steps such as quality check, filtering, normalization, batch effect detection and correction. Currently, there is a lack of standard guidelines for data preprocessing in the TGx field. Defining the optimal tools and procedures to be employed in the transcriptomics data preprocessing will lead to the generation of homogeneous and unbiased data, allowing the development of more reliable, robust and accurate predictive models. In this review, we outline methods for the preprocessing of three main transcriptomic technologies including microarray, bulk RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), and single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Moreover, we discuss the most common methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes and to perform a functional enrichment analysis. This review is the second part of a three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.",
