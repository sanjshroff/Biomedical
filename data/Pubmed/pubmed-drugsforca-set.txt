AB  - Drug repurposing is the process of developing existing or abandoned drugs for a 
      different disease. Repurposing can circumvent higher costs and times associated 
      with conventional drug discovery strategies because toxicity and pharmacokinetics 
      profiles are typically already established. This brief review focuses on efforts 
      to repurpose drugs for skin cancer and includes reuse of antihypertensives, 
      anthelmintics and antifungals among a range of other medicines. Repurposing not 
      only ushers promising known drugs for new indications, the process of repurposing 
      can uncover new mechanistic insights in the pathogenesis of disease and uncover 
      new opportunities for pharmaceutical intervention.

AB  - Drug repurposing is a valuable approach in delivering new cancer therapeutics 
      rapidly into the clinic. Existing safety and patient tolerability data for drugs 
      already in clinical use represent an untapped resource in terms of identifying 
      therapeutic agents for off-label protein targets. The multicellular effects of 
      STAT3 mediated by a range of various upstream signaling pathways make it an 
      attractive therapeutic target with utility in a range of diseases including 
      cancer, and has led to the development of a variety of STAT3 inhibitors. 
      Moreover, heightened STAT3 transcriptional activation in tumor cells and within 
      the cells of the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease progression. 
      Consequently, there are many STAT3 inhibitors in preclinical development or under 
      evaluation in clinical trials for their therapeutic efficacy predominantly in 
      inflammatory diseases and cancer. Despite these advances, many challenges remain 
      in ultimately providing STAT3 inhibitors to patients as cancer treatments, 
      highlighting the need not only for a better understanding of the mechanisms 
      associated with STAT3 activation, but also how various pharmaceutical agents 
      suppress STAT3 activity in various cancers. In this review we discuss the 
      importance of STAT3-dependent functions in cancer, review the status of compounds 
      designed as direct-acting STAT3 inhibitors, and describe some of the strategies 
      for repurposing of drugs as STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.

AB  - Drug conjugates are chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic agents covalently linked to 
      targeting ligands such as an antibody or a peptide via a linker. While 
      antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now clinically established for cancer 
      therapy, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) are gaining recognition as a new modality 
      for targeted drug delivery with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for 
      cancer treatment. The linker in a drug conjugate plays a key role in the 
      circulation time of the conjugate and release of the drug for full activity at 
      the target site. Herein, we highlight the main linker chemistries utilized in the 
      design of PDCs and discuss representative examples of PDCs with different linker 
      chemistries with the related outcome in cell and animal studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a malignant tumor with a dismay outcome. 
      Increasing evidence has confirmed that chromatin regulators (CRs) are involved in 
      cancer progression. Therefore, we aimed to explore the function and prognostic 
      value of CRs in BLCA patients. METHODS: Chromatin regulators (CRs) were acquired 
      from the previous top research. The mRNA expression and clinical information were 
      downloaded from TCGA and GEO datasets. Cox regression analysis and least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis were performed to 
      select the prognostic gene and construct the risk model for predicting outcome in 
      BLCA. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the prognosis between high- 
      and low-risk groups. We also investigated the drug sensitivity difference between 
      high- and low-risk groups. CMAP dataset was performed to screen the small 
      molecule drugs for treatment. RESULTS: We successfully constructed and validated 
      an 11 CRs-based model for predicting the prognosis of patients with BLCA. 
      Moreover, we also found 11 CRs-based model was an independent prognostic factor. 
      Functional analysis suggested that CRs were mainly enriched in cancer-related 
      signaling pathways. The CR-based model was also correlated with immune cells 
      infiltration and immune checkpoint. Patients in the high-risk group were more 
      sensitive to several drugs, such as mitomycin C, gemcitabine, cisplatin. Eight 
      small molecule drugs could be beneficial to treatment for BLCA patients. 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study provided novel insights into the function of 
      CRs in BLCA. We identified a reliable prognostic biomarker for the survival of 
      patients with BLCA.

AB  - Human malignancies are one of the major health-related issues though out the 
      world and anticipated to rise in the future. The development of novel 
      drugs/agents requires a huge amount of cost and time that represents a major 
      challenge for drug discovery. In the last three decades, the number of FDA 
      approved drugs has dropped down and this led to increasing interest in drug 
      reposition or repurposing. The present review focuses on recent concepts and 
      therapeutic opportunities for the utilization of antidiabetics, antibiotics, 
      antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antipsychotic, PDE inhibitors and estrogen 
      receptor antagonist, Antabuse, antiparasitic and cardiovascular agents/drugs as 
      an alternative approach against human malignancies. The repurposing of approved 
      non-cancerous drugs is an effective strategy to develop new therapeutic options 
      for the treatment of cancer patients at an affordable cost in clinics. In the 
      current scenario, most of the countries throughout the globe are unable to meet 
      the medical needs of cancer patients because of the high cost of the available 
      cancerous drugs. Some of these drugs displayed potential anti-cancer activity in 
      preclinic and clinical studies by regulating several key molecular mechanisms and 
      oncogenic pathways in human malignancies. The emerging pieces of evidence 
      indicate that repurposing of drugs is crucial to the faster and cheaper discovery 
      of anti-cancerous drugs.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the tyrosine kinase 
      receptors family and is present in the epithelial cell membrane. Its endogenous 
      activation occurs through the binding of different endogenous ligands, including 
      the epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to signaling cascades able to maintain 
      normal cellular functions. Although involved in the development and maintenance 
      of tissues in normal conditions, when EGFR is overexpressed, it stimulates the 
      growth and progression of tumors, resulting in angiogenesis, invasion and 
      metastasis, through some main cascades such as Ras/Raf/MAPK, PIK-3/AKT, PLC-PKC 
      and STAT. Besides, considering the limitations of conventional chemotherapy that 
      result in high toxicity and low tumor specificity, EGFR is currently considered 
      an important target. As a result, several monoclonal antibodies are currently 
      approved for use in cancer treatment, such as cetuximab (CTX), panitumumab, 
      nimotuzumab, necitumumab and others are in clinical trials. Aiming to combine the 
      chemotherapeutic agent toxicity and specific targeting to EGFR overexpressing 
      tumor tissues, two main strategies will be discussed in this review: 
      antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and antibody-nanoparticle conjugates (ANCs). 
      Briefly, ADCs consist of antibodies covalently linked through a spacer to the 
      cytotoxic drug. Upon administration, binding to EGFR and endocytosis, ADCs suffer 
      chemical and enzymatic reactions leading to the release and accumulation of the 
      drug. Instead, ANCs consist of nanotechnology-based formulations, such as lipid, 
      polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles able to protect the drug against 
      inactivation, allowing controlled release and also passive accumulation in tumor 
      tissues by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Furthermore, 
      ANCs undergo active targeting through EGFR receptor-mediated endocytosis, leading 
      to the formation of lysosomes and drug release into the cytosol. Herein, we will 
      present and discuss some important aspects regarding EGFR structure, its role on 
      internal signaling pathways and downregulation aspects. Then, considering that 
      EGFR is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy, the monoclonal 
      antibodies able to target this receptor will be presented and discussed. Finally, 
      ADCs and ANCs state of the art will be reviewed and recent studies and clinical 
      progresses will be highlighted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      review paper to address specifically the EGFR target and its application on ADCs 
      and ANCs.

TI  - Barriers for Pharmaceutical Innovation With Focus in Cancer Drugs, the Case of 
      Mexico.

AB  - Drug innovation does not only generate economic growth but also portrays a 
      country's efforts toward innovation. The article reviews the current status on 
      the innovation of the Mexican pharmaceutical industry with a focus on cancer 
      drugs. The authors examined the scientific and nonscientific literature in search 
      of the origin of innovative cancer drugs, as well as the regulatory frames by 
      which these drugs are approved in Mexico. The article presents a narrative 
      analysis of the author's experiences on the barriers that impede pharmaceutical 
      innovation in Mexico. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there was only 1 
      domestic approval by COFEPRIS, the Mexican health regulatory agency, of an 
      anticancer product developed under a repositioning approach. Among the barriers 
      impeding drug innovation in Mexico are, but not be limited to, insufficient funds 
      for the discovery phase; unaffordable or limited capacity for performing 
      preclinical studies under good laboratory practices (GLP); lengthy clinical trial 
      approval; unfavorable conditions for clinical trials for both academic and 
      domestic pharmaceutical industry-sponsored studies; unclear policies for drug 
      approvals and marketing. The authors state specific proposals for overcoming 
      these barriers to generate a climate for increasing participation of academic and 
      existing domestic pharmaceutical industry as well as to increase venture capital 
      and favor start-up and early-stage companies. In conclusion, Mexico has the human 
      resources and material infrastructure to innovate. The implementation of these 
      and any other constructive proposals are just a matter of political will.

TI  - Strategies for the treatment of breast cancer: from classical drugs to 
      mathematical models.
PG  - 6328-6385
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2021316 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and generally affects women. It 
      is a heterogeneous disease that presents different entities, different biological 
      characteristics, and differentiated clinical behaviors. With this in mind, this 
      literature review had as its main objective to analyze the path taken from the 
      simple use of classical drugs to the application of mathematical models, which 
      through the many ongoing studies, have been considered as one of the reliable 
      strategies, explaining the reasons why chemotherapy is not always successful. 
      Besides, the most commonly mentioned strategies are immunotherapy, which includes 
      techniques and therapies such as the use of antibodies, cytokines, antitumor 
      vaccines, oncolytic and genomic viruses, among others, and nanoparticles, 
      including metallic, magnetic, polymeric, liposome, dendrimer, micelle, and 
      others, as well as drug reuse, which is a process by which new therapeutic 
      indications are found for existing and approved drugs. The most commonly used 
      pharmacological categories are cardiac, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, antiviral, 
      antibiotic, and others. For the efficient development of reused drugs, there must 
      be a process of exchange of purposes, methods, and information already available, 
      and for their better understanding, computational mathematical models are then 
      used, of which the methods of blind search or screening, based on the target, 
      knowledge, signature, pathway or network and the mechanism to which it is 
      directed, stand out. To conclude it should be noted that these different 
      strategies can be applied alone or in combination with each other always to 
      improve breast cancer treatment.

AB  - A minor population of cancer cells may evade cell death from chemotherapy and 
      targeted therapy by entering a reversible slow proliferation state known as the 
      drug tolerant persister (DTP) state. This DTP state can allow cancer cells to 
      survive drug therapy long enough for additional mechanisms of acquired drug 
      resistance to develop. Thus, cancer persistence is a major obstacle to curing 
      cancers, where insight into the biology of DTP cells and therapeutic strategies 
      targeting this mechanism can have considerable clinical implications. There is 
      emerging evidence that DTP cells adapt to new environments through epigenomic 
      modification, transcriptomic regulation, flexible energy metabolism, and 
      interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we review and discuss the 
      various proposed mechanisms of cancer persister cells and the molecular features 
      underlying the DTP state, with insights into the potential therapeutic strategies 
      to conquer DTP cells and prevent cancer recurrence or therapeutic failures.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) carries a growing burden on society. Lack of curative 
      treatment and poor prognosis among patients with advanced PCa imply an urgent 
      need for novel and improved drug identification. This is hampered by the 
      disease's high molecular heterogeneity and complex molecular pathophysiology, 
      resulting in drugs being efficient in a few patients and cancer developing 
      resistance to treatment. De novo drug discovery has proven to be complex and 
      challenging. Along with technological advancements (mainly linked to -omics 
      approaches) that allow for comprehensive characterization of the molecular 
      changes underlying disease, and considering respective developments in 
      bioinformatics, computational drug repurposing has emerged as a promising 
      approach to shorten the way from discovery to clinical application and address 
      the disease molecular complexity. With this article, we aimed at reviewing recent 
      studies in which drugs/ compounds for PCa were defined through the investigation 
      of molecular profiling (-omics) data and the application of drug repurposing 
      strategies. A brief overview of the technical requirements and associated 
      challenges with the latter are also provided. For that purpose, a literature 
      search was conducted using the PubMed database. Numerous drugs/ compounds have 
      been proposed as potential PCa therapeutics, mostly based on the investigation of 
      genomics and transcriptomics data. In most cases, further assessment in disease 
      models is required. Since ultimately proteins are targeted by drugs, expanding on 
      the use of proteomics profiling data (alone or in combination with other -omics) 
      is expected to advance further defining new/repurposed drugs for PCa.
