TI  - Chemoinformatics Strategies for Leishmaniasis Drug Discovery.
PG  - 1278

LID - 1278
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a fatal neglected tropical disease (NTD) that is caused by more 
      than 20 species of Leishmania parasites. The disease kills approximately 20,000 
      people each year and more than 1 billion are susceptible to infection. Although 
      counting on a few compounds, the therapeutic arsenal faces some drawbacks such as 
      drug resistance, toxicity issues, high treatment costs, and accessibility 
      problems, which highlight the need for novel treatment options. Worldwide efforts 
      have been made to that aim and, as well as in other therapeutic areas, 
      chemoinformatics have contributed significantly to leishmaniasis drug discovery. 
      Breakthrough advances in the comprehension of the parasites' molecular biology 
      have enabled the design of high-affinity ligands for a number of macromolecular 
      targets. In addition, the use of chemoinformatics has allowed highly accurate 
      predictions of biological activity and physicochemical and pharmacokinetics 
      properties of novel antileishmanial compounds. This review puts into perspective 
      the current context of leishmaniasis drug discovery and focuses on the use of 
      chemoinformatics to develop better therapies for this life-threatening condition.

AB  - This article presents a study of the literature of chemoinformatics, updating and 
      building upon an analogous bibliometric investigation that was published in 2008. 
      Data on outputs in the field, and citations to those outputs, were obtained by 
      means of topic searches of the Web of Science Core Collection. The searches 
      demonstrate that chemoinformatics is by now a well-defined sub-discipline of 
      chemistry, and one that forms an essential part of the chemical educational 
      curriculum. There are three core journals for the subject: The Journal of 
      Chemical Information and Modeling, the Journal of Cheminformatics, and Molecular 
      Informatics, and, having established itself, chemoinformatics is now starting to 
      export knowledge to disciplines outside of chemistry.

AB  - Due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, there is a growing 
      need to discover new antibiotics. To address this challenge, we trained a deep 
      neural network capable of predicting molecules with antibacterial activity. We 
      performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule 
      from the Drug Repurposing Hub-halicin-that is structurally divergent from 
      conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide 
      phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated 
      Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in 
      murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested 
      predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our 
      model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from 
      known antibiotics. This work highlights the utility of deep learning approaches 
      to expand our antibiotic arsenal through the discovery of structurally distinct 
      antibacterial molecules.

AB  - Chemoinformatics is an established discipline focusing on extracting, processing 
      and extrapolating meaningful data from chemical structures. With the rapid 
      explosion of chemical 'big' data from HTS and combinatorial synthesis, machine 
      learning has become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical 
      information from large compound databases to design drugs with important 
      biological properties. To process the chemical data, we first reviewed multiple 
      processing layers in the chemoinformatics pipeline followed by the introduction 
      of commonly used machine learning models in drug discovery and QSAR analysis. 
      Here, we present basic principles and recent case studies to demonstrate the 
      utility of machine learning techniques in chemoinformatics analyses; and we 
      discuss limitations and future directions to guide further development in this 
      evolving field.

AB  - The intertwining of chemoinformatics with artificial intelligence (AI) has given 
      a tremendous fillip to the field of drug discovery. With the rapid growth of 
      chemical data from high throughput screening and combinatorial synthesis, AI has 
      become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical information from 
      large compound databases for developing drugs at a much faster rate as never 
      before. The applications of AI have gone beyond bioactivity predictions and have 
      shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery like de novo 
      molecular design, synthesis prediction and biological image analysis. In this 
      article, we provide an overview of all the algorithms under the umbrella of AI, 
      enlist the tools/frameworks required for implementing these algorithms as well as 
      present a compendium of web servers, databases and open-source platforms 
      implicated in drug discovery, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 
      (QSAR), data mining, solvation free energy and molecular graph mining.

      important approach. In recent years, increasing computational resources and new 
      deep learning algorithms have put machine learning onto a new level, addressing 
      previously unmet challenges in pharmaceutical research. In silico approaches for 
      compound activity predictions, de novo design, and reaction modeling have been 
      further advanced by new algorithmic developments and the emergence of big data in 
      the field. Herein, novel applications of machine learning and deep learning in 
      chemoinformatics and medicinal chemistry are reviewed. Opportunities and 
      challenges for new methods and applications are discussed, placing emphasis on 
      proper baseline comparisons, robust validation methodologies, and new 
      applicability domains.

TI  - Chemoinformatics for the Safety of Energetic and Reactive Materials at Ineris.
PG  - e2000190
LID - 10.1002/minf.202000190 [doi]
AB  - The characterization of physical hazards of substances is a key information to 
      manage the risks associated to their use, storage and transport. With decades of 
      work in this area, Ineris develops and implements cutting-edge experimental 
      facilities allowing such characterizations at different scales and under various 
      conditions to study all of the dreaded accident scenarios. This review presents 
      the efforts engaged by Ineris more recently in the field of chemoinformatics to 
      develop and use new predictive methods for the anticipation and management of 
      industrials risks associated to energetic and reactive materials as a complement 
      to experiments. An overview of the methods used for the development of 
      Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for physical hazards are presented 
      and discussed regarding the specificities associated to this class of properties. 
      A review of models developed at Ineris is also provided from the first tentative 
      models on the explosivity of nitro compounds to the successful application to the 
      flammability of organic mixtures. Then, a discussion is proposed on the use of 
      QSPR models. Good practices for robust use for QSPR models are recalled with 
      specific comments related to physical hazards, notably for regulatory purpose. 
      Dissemination and training efforts engaged by Ineris are also presented. The 
      potential offered by these predictive methods in terms of in silico design and 
      for the development of new intrinsically safer technologies in safety-by-design 
      strategies is finally discussed. At last, challenges and perspectives to extend 
      the application of chemoinformatics in the field of safety and in particular for 
      the physical hazards of energetic and reactive substances are proposed.

TI  - Chemoinformatics at IFP Energies Nouvelles: Applications in the Fields of Energy, 
      Transport, and Environment.
LID - 10.1002/minf.201700028 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present paper is to summarize chemoinformatics based 
      research, and more precisely, the development of quantitative structure property 
      relationships performed at IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN) during the last decade. 
      A special focus is proposed on research activities performed in the 
      "Thermodynamics and Molecular Simulation" department, i. e. the use of multiscale 
      molecular simulation methods in responses to projects. Molecular simulation 
      techniques can be envisaged to supplement dataset when experimental information 
      lacks, thus the review includes a section dedicated to molecular simulation 
      codes, development of intermolecular potentials, and some of their possible 
      applications. Know-how and feedback from our experiences in terms of machine 
      learning application for thermophysical property predictions are included in a 
      section dealing with methodological aspects. The generic character of 
      chemoinformatics is emphasized through applications in the fields of energy, 
      transport, and environment, with illustrations for three IFPEN business units: 
      "Transports", "Energy Resources", and "Processes". More precisely, the review 
      focus on different challenges such as the prediction of properties for 
      alternative fuels, the prediction of fuel compatibility with polymeric materials, 
      the prediction of properties for surfactants usable in chemical enhanced oil 
      recovery, and the prediction of guest-host interactions between gases and 
      nanoporous materials in the frame of carbon dioxide capture or gas separation 
      activities.

TI  - Chemoinformatics View on Bitter Taste Receptor Agonists in Food.
PG  - 13916-13924
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05057 [doi]
AB  - Food compounds with a bitter taste have a role in human health, both for their 
      capability to influence food choice and preferences and for their possible 
      systemic effect due to the modulation of extra-oral bitter taste receptors 
      (TAS2Rs). Investigating the interaction of bitter food compounds with TAS2Rs is a 
      key step to unravel their complex effects on health and to pave the way to 
      rationally design new additives for food formulation or drugs. Here, we propose a 
      collection of food bitter compounds, for which in vitro activity data against 
      TAS2Rs are available. The patterns of TAS2R subtype-specific agonists were 
      analyzed using scaffold decomposition and chemical space analysis, providing a 
      detailed characterization of the associations between food bitter tastants and 
      TAS2Rs.

TI  - Chemoinformatics-based enumeration of chemical libraries: a tutorial.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1186/s13321-020-00466-z [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - Virtual compound libraries are increasingly being used in computer-assisted drug 
      discovery applications and have led to numerous successful cases. This paper aims 
      to examine the fundamental concepts of library design and describe how to 
      enumerate virtual libraries using open source tools. To exemplify the enumeration 
      of chemical libraries, we emphasize the use of pre-validated or reported 
      reactions and accessible chemical reagents. This tutorial shows a step-by-step 
      procedure for anyone interested in designing and building chemical libraries with 
      or without chemoinformatics experience. The aim is to explore various 
      methodologies proposed by synthetic organic chemists and explore affordable 
      chemical space using open-access chemoinformatics tools. As part of the tutorial, 
      we discuss three examples of design: a Diversity-Oriented-Synthesis library based 
      on lactams, a bis-heterocyclic combinatorial library, and a set of 
      target-oriented molecules: isoindolinone based compounds as potential 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This manuscript also seeks to contribute to the 
      critical task of teaching and learning chemoinformatics.
