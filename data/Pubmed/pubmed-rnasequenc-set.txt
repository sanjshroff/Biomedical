AB  - Over the past decade, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable tool 
      for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression and differential 
      splicing of mRNAs. However, as next-generation sequencing technologies have 
      developed, so too has RNA-seq. Now, RNA-seq methods are available for studying 
      many different aspects of RNA biology, including single-cell gene expression, 
      translation (the translatome) and RNA structure (the structurome). Exciting new 
      applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). 
      Together with new long-read and direct RNA-seq technologies and better 
      computational tools for data analysis, innovations in RNA-seq are contributing to 
      a fuller understanding of RNA biology, from questions such as when and where 
      transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern 
      RNA function.

AB  - Rapid progress in the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      technologies in recent years has provided many valuable insights into complex 
      biological systems, ranging from cancer genomics to diverse microbial 
      communities. NGS-based technologies for genomics, transcriptomics, and 
      epigenomics are now increasingly focused on the characterization of individual 
      cells. These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and 
      potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional profiling 
      methods that assess bulk populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for 
      example, can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory 
      relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages 
      in development. In this review, we will focus on technical challenges in 
      single-cell isolation and library preparation and on computational analysis 
      pipelines available for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Further technical improvements 
      at the level of molecular and cell biology and in available bioinformatics tools 
      will greatly facilitate both the basic science and medical applications of these 
      sequencing technologies.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to address 
      biological and medical questions. However, systematic comparisons of the 
      performance of diverse scRNA-seq protocols are lacking. We generated data from 
      583 mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate six prominent scRNA-seq methods: 
      CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq, and Smart-seq2. While 
      Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, 
      MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due 
      to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different 
      sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome 
      quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and 
      Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative 
      comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq 
      methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of 
      scRNA-seq protocols.

AB  - Over the past few decades, RNA sequencing has significantly progressed, becoming 
      a paramount approach for transcriptome profiling. The revolution from bulk RNA 
      sequencing to single-molecular, single-cell and spatial transcriptome approaches 
      has enabled increasingly accurate, individual cell resolution incorporated with 
      spatial information. Cancer, a major malignant and heterogeneous lethal disease, 
      remains an enormous challenge in medical research and clinical treatment. As a 
      vital tool, RNA sequencing has been utilized in many aspects of cancer research 
      and therapy, including biomarker discovery and characterization of cancer 
      heterogeneity and evolution, drug resistance, cancer immune microenvironment and 
      immunotherapy, cancer neoantigens and so on. In this review, the latest studies 
      on RNA sequencing technology and their applications in cancer are summarized, and 
      future challenges and opportunities for RNA sequencing technology in cancer 
      applications are discussed.

AB  - Cells are the basic building blocks of organisms and each cell is unique. 
      Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an indispensable tool to dissect the 
      cellular heterogeneity and decompose tissues into cell types and/or cell states, 
      which offers enormous potential for de novo discovery. Single-cell transcriptomic 
      atlases provide unprecedented resolution to reveal complex cellular events and 
      deepen our understanding of biological systems. In this review, we summarize and 
      compare single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, that were developed since 2009, 
      to facilitate a well-informed choice of method. The applications of these methods 
      in different biological contexts are also discussed. We anticipate an 
      ever-increasing role of single-cell RNA sequencing in biology with further 
      improvement in providing spatial information and coupling to other cellular 
      modalities. In the future, such biological findings will greatly benefit medical 
      research.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful, rapidly 
      developing tool for characterizing individual cells and elucidating biological 
      mechanisms at the cellular level. Cardiovascular disease is one of the major 
      causes of death worldwide and its precise pathology remains unclear. scRNA-seq 
      has provided many novel insights into both healthy and pathological hearts. In 
      this review, we summarize the various scRNA-seq platforms and describe the 
      molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular development and disease revealed by 
      scRNA-seq analysis. We then describe the latest technological advances in 
      scRNA-seq. Finally, we discuss how to translate basic research into clinical 
      medicine using scRNA-seq technology.

AB  - Thanks to innovative sample-preparation and sequencing technologies, gene 
      expression in individual cells can now be measured for thousands of cells in a 
      single experiment. Since its introduction, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
      approaches have revolutionized the genomics field as they created unprecedented 
      opportunities for resolving cell heterogeneity by exploring gene expression 
      profiles at a single-cell resolution. However, the rapidly evolving field of 
      scRNA-seq invoked the emergence of various analytics approaches aimed to maximize 
      the full potential of this novel strategy. Unlike population-based RNA sequencing 
      approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address 
      high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated 
      challenges. Despite the vast number of analytical methods, a universal 
      standardization is lacking. While this reflects the fields' immaturity, it may 
      also encumber a newcomer to blend in.In this review, we aim to bridge over the 
      abovementioned hurdle and propose four ready-to-use pipelines for scRNA-seq 
      analysis easily accessible by a newcomer, that could fit various biological data 
      types. Here we provide an overview of the currently available single-cell 
      technologies for cell isolation and library preparation and a step by step guide 
      that covers the entire canonical analytic workflow to analyse scRNA-seq data 
      including read mapping, quality controls, gene expression quantification, 
      normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cell clustering 
      useful for trajectory inference and differential expression. Such workflow 
      guidelines will escort novices as well as expert users in the analysis of complex 
      scRNA-seq datasets, thus further expanding the research potential of single-cell 
      approaches in basic science, and envisaging its future implementation as best 
      practice in the field.

AB  - During the last decade, high-throughput sequencing methods have revolutionized 
      the entire field of biology. The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in 
      great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries 
      and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically 
      performed in "bulk," and the data represent an average of gene expression 
      patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically 
      relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an 
      approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their 
      transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are 
      mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological 
      properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented 
      resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and 
      the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider 
      before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons,

AB  - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can not only be used to identify the expression of 
      common or rare transcripts but also in the identification of other abnormal 
      events, such as alternative splicing, novel transcripts, and fusion genes. In 
      principle, RNA-seq can be carried out by almost all of the next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) platforms, but the libraries of different platforms are not 
      exactly the same; each platform has its own kit to meet the special requirements 
      of the instrument design.
