AB  - There is a great deal of hype surrounding the concept of personalized medicine. 
      Personalized medicine is rooted in the belief that since individuals possess 
      nuanced and unique characteristics at the molecular, physiological, environmental 
      exposure, and behavioral levels, they may need to have interventions provided to 
      them for diseases they possess that are tailored to these nuanced and unique 
      characteristics. This belief has been verified to some degree through the 
      application of emerging technologies such as DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging 
      protocols, and wireless health monitoring devices, which have revealed great 
      inter-individual variation in disease processes. In this review, we consider the 
      motivation for personalized medicine, its historical precedents, the emerging 
      technologies that are enabling it, some recent experiences including successes 
      and setbacks, ways of vetting and deploying personalized medicines, and future 
      directions, including potential ways of treating individuals with fertility and 
      sterility issues. We also consider current limitations of personalized medicine. 
      We ultimately argue that since aspects of personalized medicine are rooted in 
      biological realities, personalized medicine practices in certain contexts are 
      likely to be inevitable, especially as relevant assays and deployment strategies 
      become more efficient and cost-effective.

AB  - Following the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, research in 
      oncology has progressively focused on the sequencing of cancer genomes, with the 
      aim of better understanding the genetic basis of oncogenesis and identifying 
      actionable alterations. The development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) 
      techniques, commercially available since 2006, allowed for a cost- and 
      time-effective sequencing of tumor DNA, leading to a "genomic era" of cancer 
      research and treatment. NGS provided a significant step forward in Personalized 
      Medicine (PM) by enabling the detection of somatic driver mutations, resistance 
      mechanisms, quantification of mutational burden, germline mutations which settled 
      the foundation of a new approach in cancer care. In this chapter we discuss the 
      history, available techniques and applications of NGS in oncology, with a 
      particular referral to the PM approach and the emerging role of the research 
      field of pharmacogenomics.

TI  - Ethical Issues Surrounding Personalized Medicine: A Literature Review.
PG  - 209-217
AB  - More than a decade ago, personalized medicine was presented in modern medicine. 
      Personalized medicine means that the right drug should be prescribed for the 
      right patient based on genetic data. No doubt is developing medical sciences, and 
      its shift into personalized medicine complicates ethical challenges more than 
      before. In this review, we categorized all probable ethical considerations of 
      personalized medicine in research and development and service provision. Based on 
      our review, extensive changes in healthcare system including ethical changes are 
      needed to overcome the ethical obstacles including knowledge gap and informed 
      consent, privacy and confidentiality and availability of healthcare services. 
      Furthermore social benefit versus science development and individual benefit 
      should be balanced. Therefore guidelines and regulations should be compiled to 
      represent the ethical framework; also ethical decision making should be 
      day-to-day and individualized.

AB  - Pharmacogenomics is one of the emerging approaches to precision medicine, 
      tailoring drug selection and dosing to the patient's genetic features. In recent 
      years, several pharmacogenetic guidelines have been published by international 
      scientific consortia, but the uptake in clinical practice is still poor. Many 
      coordinated international efforts are ongoing in order to overcome the existing 
      barriers to pharmacogenomic implementation. On the other hand, existing validated 
      pharmacogenomic markers can explain only a minor part of the observed clinical 
      variability in the therapeutic outcome. New investigational approaches are 
      warranted, including the study of the pharmacogenomic role of the immune system 
      genetics and of previously neglected rare genetic variants, reported to account 
      for a large part of the inter-individual variability in drug metabolism. In this 
      Special Issue, we collected a series of articles covering many aspects of 
      pharmacogenomics. These include clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics in 
      clinical practice, development of tools or infrastractures to support this 
      process, research of new pharmacogenomics markers to increase drug efficacy and 
      safety, and the impact of rare genetic variants in pharmacogenomics.

LID - 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000376 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe recent developments in therapies which target the 
      molecular mechanisms in atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Current advances in 
      the understanding of the molecular basis of atopic dermatitis are leading to the 
      stratification of different atopic dermatitis phenotypes. New therapies offer the 
      option to target-specific molecules involved in the pathophysiology of atopic 
      dermatitis. Current new therapies under investigation aim to modulate specific 
      inflammatory pathways associated with distinctive atopic dermatitis phenotypes, 
      which would potentially translate into the development of personalized, 
      targeted-specific treatments of atopic dermatitis. SUMMARY: Despite the unmet 
      need for well tolerated, effective, and personalized treatment of atopic 
      dermatitis, the current standard treatments of atopic dermatitis do not focus on 
      the individual pathogenesis of the disease. The development of targeted, 
      phenotype-specific therapies has the potential to open a new promising era of 
      individualized treatment of atopic dermatitis.

AB  - Personalized medicine as a novel field of medicine refers to the prescription of 
      specific therapeutics procedure for an individual. This approach has established 
      based on pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic information and data. The terms 
      precision and personalized medicines are sometimes applied interchangeably. 
      However, there has been a shift from "personalized medicine" towards "precision 
      medicine". Although personalized medicine emerged from pharmacogenetics, nowadays 
      it covers many fields of healthcare. Accordingly, regenerative medicine and 
      cellular therapy as the new fields of medicine use cell-based products in order 
      to develop personalized treatments. Different sources of stem cells including 
      mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs) have been considered in targeted therapies which could give many 
      advantages. iPSCs as the novel and individual pluripotent stem cells have been 
      introduced as the appropriate candidates for personalized cell therapies. 
      Cellular therapies can provide a personalized approach. Because of 
      person-to-person and population differences in the result of stem cell therapy, 
      individualized cellular therapy must be adjusted according to the patient 
      specific profile, in order to achieve best therapeutic results and outcomes. 
      Several factors should be considered to achieve personalized stem cells therapy 
      such as, recipient factors, donor factors, and the overall body environment in 
      which the stem cells could be active and functional. In addition to these 
      factors, the source of stem cells must be carefully chosen based on functional 
      and physical criteria that lead to optimal outcomes.

AB  - Personalized medicine has largely been enabled by the integration of genomic and 
      other data with electronic health records (EHRs) in the United States and 
      elsewhere. Increased EHR adoption across various clinical settings and the 
      establishment of EHR-linked population-based biobanks provide unprecedented 
      opportunities for the types of translational and implementation research that 
      drive personalized medicine. We review advances in the digitization of health 
      information and the proliferation of genomic research in health systems and 
      provide insights into emerging paths for the widespread implementation of 
      personalized medicine.

AB  - The personalized medicine is an emergent and rapidly developing method of 
      clinical practice that uses new technologies to provide decisions in regard to 
      the prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. A continuous 
      evolution of technology and the developments in molecular diagnostics and genomic 
      analysis increased the possibility of an even more understanding and 
      interpretation of the human genome and exome, allowing a "personalized" approach 
      to clinical care, so that the concepts of "Systems Medicine" and "System Biology" 
      are actually increasing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
      personalized medicine about its indications and benefits, actual clinical 
      applications and future perspectives as well as its issues and health care 
      implications. A careful review of the scientific literature on this field that 
      highlighted the applicability and usefulness of this new medical approach as well 
      as the fact that personalized medicine strategy is even more increasing in 
      numerous fields of applications.

AB  - Individualizing patient treatment is a core objective of the medical field. 
      Reaching this objective has been elusive owing to the complex set of factors 
      contributing to both disease and health; many factors, from genes to proteins, 
      remain unknown in their role in human physiology. Accurately diagnosing, 
      monitoring, and treating disorders requires advances in biomarker discovery, the 
      subsequent development of accurate signatures that correspond with dynamic 
      disease states, as well as therapeutic interventions that can be continuously 
      optimized and modulated for dose and drug selection. This work highlights key 
      breakthroughs in the development of enabling technologies that further the goal 
      of personalized and precision medicine, and remaining challenges that, when 
      addressed, may forge unprecedented capabilities in realizing truly individualized 
      patient care.

AB  - A wide variety of organs are in a dynamic state, continuously undergoing renewal 
      as a result of constant growth and differentiation. Stem cells are required 
      during these dynamic events for continuous tissue maintenance within the organs. 
      In a steady state of production and loss of cells within these tissues, new cells 
      are constantly formed by differentiation from stem cells. Today, organoids 
      derived from either adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells can be grown to 
      resemble various organs. As they are similar to their original organs, organoids 
      hold great promise for use in medical research and the development of new 
      treatments. Furthermore, they have already been utilized in the clinic, enabling 
      personalized medicine for inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, I provide 
      an update on current organoid technology and summarize the application of 
      organoids in basic research, disease modeling, drug development, personalized 
      treatment, and regenerative medicine.
