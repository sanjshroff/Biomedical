AB  - Medical genomics relies on next-gen sequencing methods to decipher underlying 
      molecular mechanisms of gene expression. This special issue collects materials 
      originally presented at the "Centenary of Human Population Genetics" 
      Conference-2019, in Moscow. Here we present some recent developments in 
      computational methods tested on actual medical genetics problems dissected 
      through genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data analysis, gene networks, 
      protein-protein interactions and biomedical literature mining. We have selected 
      materials based on systems biology approaches, database mining. These methods and 
      algorithms were discussed at the Digital Medical Forum-2019, organized by I.M. 
      Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University presenting bioinformatics 
      approaches for the drug targets discovery in cancer, its computational support, 
      and digitalization of medical research, as well as at "Systems Biology and 
      Bioinformatics"-2019 (SBB-2019) Young Scientists School in Novosibirsk, Russia. 
      Selected recent advancements discussed at these events in the medical genomics 
      and genetics areas are based on novel bioinformatics tools.

AB  - The recent maturation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has 
      coincided with transformative new methods to profile genetic, epigenetic, 
      spatial, proteomic and lineage information in individual cells. This provides 
      unique opportunities, alongside computational challenges, for integrative methods 
      that can jointly learn across multiple types of data. Integrated analysis can 
      discover relationships across cellular modalities, learn a holistic 
      representation of the cell state, and enable the pooling of data sets produced 
      across individuals and technologies. In this Review, we discuss the recent 
      advances in the collection and integration of different data types at single-cell 
      resolution with a focus on the integration of gene expression data with other 
      types of single-cell measurement.

TI  - BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical 
      text mining.
PG  - 1234-1240
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the 
      number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural 
      language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical 
      literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted 
      the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly 
      applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields 
      unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain 
      corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently 
      introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. 
      RESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
      Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language 
      representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost 
      the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous 
      state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when 
      pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to 
      that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them 
      on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical 
      named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation 
      extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% 
      MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical 
      corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at 
      https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning 
      BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.

TI  - Generating the Blood Exposome Database Using a Comprehensive Text Mining and 
      Database Fusion Approach.
PG  - 97008
LID - 10.1289/EHP4713 [doi]
LID - 097008
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical 
      research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, 
      or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of 
      blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of 
      endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating 
      system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we 
      retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary 
      tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate 
      phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by 
      a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify 
      blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. 
      Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem 
      chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 
      851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed 
      database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of 
      open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database 
      yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three 
      approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 
      65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these 
      compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, 
      governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay 
      repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 
      compounds to blood-related primary publications. CONCLUSION: This new Blood 
      Exposome Database can be used for prioritizing chemicals for systematic reviews, 
      developing target assays in exposome research, identifying compounds in 
      untargeted mass spectrometry, and biological interpretation in metabolomics data. 
      The database is available at http://bloodexposome.org.

PG  - 6674744
LID - 10.1155/2021/6674744 [doi]
LID - 6674744
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative joint disease, 
      which causes stiffness, pain, and decreased function. At the early stage of OA, 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the first-line 
      treatment. However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies are 
      limited. We aim to use bioinformatics to identify potential genes and drugs 
      associated with OA. METHODS: The genes related to OA and NSAIDs therapy were 
      determined by text mining. Then, the common genes were performed for GO, KEGG 
      pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Using 
      the MCODE plugin-obtained hub genes, the expression levels of hub genes were 
      verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The 
      confirmed genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database to determine 
      potential genes and drugs. RESULTS: The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression 
      level of 15 genes was significantly increased in OA samples. Finally, eight 
      potential genes were targetable to a total of 53 drugs, twenty-one of which have 
      been employed to treat OA and 32 drugs have not yet been used in OA. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The 15 genes (including PTGS2, NLRP3, MMP9, IL1RN, CCL2, TNF, IL10, CD40, IL6, 
      NGF, TP53, RELA, BCL2L1, VEGFA, and NOTCH1) and 32 drugs, which have not been 
      used in OA but approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be potential genes 
      and drugs, respectively, to improve OA treatment. Additionally, those methods 
      provided tremendous opportunities to facilitate drug repositioning efforts and 
      study novel target pharmacology in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - The fields of medicine science and health informatics have made great progress 
      recently and have led to in-depth analytics that is demanded by generation, 
      collection and accumulation of massive data. Meanwhile, we are entering a new 
      period where novel technologies are starting to analyze and explore knowledge 
      from tremendous amount of data, bringing limitless potential for information 
      growth. One fact that cannot be ignored is that the techniques of machine 
      learning and deep learning applications play a more significant role in the 
      success of bioinformatics exploration from biological data point of view, and a 
      linkage is emphasized and established to bridge these two data analytics 
      techniques and bioinformatics in both industry and academia. This survey 
      concentrates on the review of recent researches using data mining and deep 
      learning approaches for analyzing the specific domain knowledge of 
      bioinformatics. The authors give a brief but pithy summarization of numerous data 
      mining algorithms used for preprocessing, classification and clustering as well 
      as various optimized neural network architectures in deep learning methods, and 
      their advantages and disadvantages in the practical applications are also 
      discussed and compared in terms of their industrial usage. It is believed that in 
      this review paper, valuable insights are provided for those who are dedicated to 
      start using data analytics methods in bioinformatics.

TI  - miRBase: from microRNA sequences to function.
PG  - D155-D162
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1141 [doi]
AB  - miRBase catalogs, names and distributes microRNA gene sequences. The latest 
      release of miRBase (v22) contains microRNA sequences from 271 organisms: 38 589 
      hairpin precursors and 48 860 mature microRNAs. We describe improvements to the 
      database and website to provide more information about the quality of microRNA 
      gene annotations, and the cellular functions of their products. We have collected 
      1493 small RNA deep sequencing datasets and mapped a total of 5.5 billion reads 
      to microRNA sequences. The read mapping patterns provide strong support for the 
      validity of between 20% and 65% of microRNA annotations in different well-studied 
      animal genomes, and evidence for the removal of >200 sequences from the database. 
      To improve the availability of microRNA functional information, we are 
      disseminating Gene Ontology terms annotated against miRBase sequences. We have 
      also used a text-mining approach to search for microRNA gene names in the 
      full-text of open access articles. Over 500 000 sentences from 18 542 papers 
      contain microRNA names. We score these sentences for functional information and 
      link them with 12 519 microRNA entries. The sentences themselves, and word clouds 
      built from them, provide effective summaries of the functional information about 
      specific microRNAs. miRBase is publicly and freely available at 
      http://mirbase.org/.

TI  - Open Agile text mining for bioinformatics: the PubAnnotation ecosystem.
PG  - 4372-4380
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz227 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Most currently available text mining tools share two characteristics 
      that make them less than optimal for use by biomedical researchers: they require 
      extensive specialist skills in natural language processing and they were built on 
      the assumption that they should optimize global performance metrics on 
      representative datasets. This is a problem because most end-users are not natural 
      language processing specialists and because biomedical researchers often care 
      less about global metrics like F-measure or representative datasets than they do 
      about more granular metrics such as precision and recall on their own specialized 
      datasets. Thus, there are fundamental mismatches between the assumptions of much 
      text mining work and the preferences of potential end-users. RESULTS: This 
      article introduces the concept of Agile text mining, and presents the 
      PubAnnotation ecosystem as an example implementation. The system approaches the 
      problems from two perspectives: it allows the reformulation of text mining by 
      biomedical researchers from the task of assembling a complete system to the task 
      of retrieving warehoused annotations, and it makes it possible to do very 
      targeted customization of the pre-existing system to address specific end-user 
      requirements. Two use cases are presented: assisted curation of the GlycoEpitope 
      database, and assessing coverage in the literature of pre-eclampsia-associated 
      genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The three tools that make up the 
      ecosystem, PubAnnotation, PubDictionaries and TextAE are publicly available as 
      web services, and also as open source projects. The dictionaries and the 
      annotation datasets associated with the use cases are all publicly available 
      through PubDictionaries and PubAnnotation, respectively.

AB  - While we have a basic understanding of the functioning of the gene when coding 
      sequences of specific proteins, we feel the lack of information on the role that 
      DNA has on specific diseases or functions of thousands of proteins that are 
      produced. Bioinformatics combines the methods used in the collection, storage, 
      identification, analysis, and correlation of this huge and complex information. 
      All this work produces an "ocean" of information that can only be "sailed" with 
      the help of computerized methods. The goal is to provide scientists with the 
      right means to explain normal biological processes, dysfunctions of these 
      processes which give rise to disease and approaches that allow the discovery of 
      new medical cures. Recently, sequencing platforms, a large scale of genomes and 
      transcriptomes, have created new challenges not only to the genomics but 
      especially for bioinformatics. The intent of this article is to compile a list of 
      tools and information resources used by scientists to treat information from the 
      massive sequencing of recent platforms to new generations and the applications of 
      this information in different areas of life sciences including medicine. KEY 
      POINTS: • Biological data mining • Omic approaches • From genotype to phenotype.
