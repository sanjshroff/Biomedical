AB  - Food effect, also known as food-drug interactions, is a common phenomenon 
      associated with orally administered medications and can be defined as changes in 
      absorption rate or absorption extent. The mechanisms of food effect and their 
      consequences can involve multiple factors, including human post-prandial 
      physiology, properties of the drug, and how the drug is administered. Therefore, 
      it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these mechanisms when 
      recommending whether a specific drug should be taken with or without food. 
      Food-drug interactions can be clinically relevant, especially when they must be 
      avoided to prevent undesirable effects or exploited to optimize medication 
      therapy. This review conducts a literature search that examined studies on food 
      effect. We summarized the literature and identified and discussed common food 
      effect mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlighted drugs that have a clinically 
      significant food effect and discussed the corresponding mechanisms. In addition, 
      this review analyzes the effects of high-fat food or standard meals on the oral 
      drug absorption rate and absorption extent for 229 drugs based on the 
      Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System and demonstrates an 
      association between Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System class 
      and food effect.

      An update review.

AB  - This review addressed drug interactions precipitated by fruit juices other than 
      grapefruit juice based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Literature was 
      identified by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science till 
      December 30 2017. Among 46 finally included RCTs, six RCTs simply addressed 
      pharmacodynamic interactions and 33 RCTs studied pharmacokinetic interactions, 
      whereas seven RCTs investigated both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      interactions. Twenty-two juice-drug combinations showed potential clinical 
      relevance. The beneficial combinations included orange juice-ferrous fumarate, 
      lemon juice-(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin, pomegranate juice-intravenous iron during 
      hemodialysis, cranberry juice-triple therapy medications for H. pylori, blueberry 
      juice-etanercept, lime juice-antimalarials, and wheat grass juice-chemotherapy. 
      The potential adverse interactions included decreased drug bioavailability (apple 
      juice-fexofenadine, atenolol, aliskiren; orange juice-aliskiren, atenolol, 
      celiprolol, montelukast, fluoroquinolones, alendronate; pomelo juice-sildenafil; 
      grape juice-cyclosporine), increased bioavailability (Seville orange 
      juice-felodipine, pomelo juice-cyclosporine, orange-aluminum containing 
      antacids). Unlike furanocoumarin-rich grapefruit juice which could primarily 
      precipitate drug interactions by strong inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 
      isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein and thus cause deadly outcomes due to co-ingestion 
      with some medications, other fruit juices did not precipitate severely 
      detrimental food-drug interaction despite of sporadic case reports. The extent of 
      a juice-drug interaction may be associated with volume of drinking juice, fruit 
      varieties, type of fruit, time between juice drinking and drug intake, genetic 
      polymorphism in the enzymes or transporters and anthropometric variables. 
      Pharmacists and health professionals should properly screen for and educate 
      patients about potential adverse juice-drug interactions and help minimize their 
      occurrence. Much attention should be paid to adolescents and the elderly who 
      ingest medications with drinking fruit juices or consume fresh fruits during drug 
      treatment. Meanwhile, more researches in this interesting issue should be 
      conducted.

AB  - The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of 
      VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can 
      result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of 
      under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., 
      augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, 
      foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio 
      of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are 
      poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have 
      established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. 
      However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. 
      Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their 
      potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter 
      medications.

AB  - The simultaneous intake of food and drugs can have a strong impact on drug 
      release, absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination and 
      consequently, on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy. As such, food-drug 
      interactions are one of the main challenges in oral drug administration. Whereas 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) food-drug interactions can have a variety of causes, 
      pharmacodynamic (PD) food-drug interactions occur due to specific pharmacological 
      interactions between a drug and particular drinks or food. In recent years, 
      extensive efforts were made to elucidate the mechanisms that drive 
      pharmacokinetic food-drug interactions. Their occurrence depends mainly on the 
      properties of the drug substance, the formulation and a multitude of 
      physiological factors. Every intake of food or drink changes the physiological 
      conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a precise 
      understanding of how different foods and drinks affect the processes of drug 
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination as well as formulation 
      performance is important in order to be able to predict and avoid such 
      interactions. Furthermore, it must be considered that beverages such as milk, 
      grapefruit juice and alcohol can also lead to specific food-drug interactions. In 
      this regard, the growing use of food supplements and functional food requires 
      urgent attention in oral pharmacotherapy. Recently, a new consortium in 
      Understanding Gastrointestinal Absorption-related Processes (UNGAP) was 
      established through COST, a funding organisation of the European Union supporting 
      translational research across Europe. In this review of the UNGAP Working group 
      "Food-Drug Interface", the different mechanisms that can lead to pharmacokinetic 
      food-drug interactions are discussed and summarised from different expert 
      perspectives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Provide an up-to-date review for health care providers regarding 
      clinically significant food-drug interactions and summarize recommendations for 
      optimal medication administration in older adults and long-term care patients. 
      DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and IPA 
      abstracts to locate relevant articles published between January 1982 and July 
      2017. DAILYMED was used to identify manufacturer-specific medication 
      administration recommendations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles 
      were reviewed for inclusion based on their relevance to this subject matter and 
      the integrity of the information provided. Additionally, the package labeling of 
      included products was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current recommendations for 
      specific medication administration with regard to food are summarized 
      descriptively. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant food-drug interactions are 
      common and have been reported with multiple classes of medications. However, 
      there are a limited number of studies examining food-drug interactions, and the 
      majority of recommendations are made by product-specific manufacturers. 
      Pharmacists should be aware of common food-drug interactions in the community, 
      assisted living, long-term care, subacute care, and hospital settings. To 
      optimize medication therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes, it is important for 
      pharmacists and other health care providers to identify agents with potential for 
      food-drug interactions and to understand the clinical relevance of such 
      interactions.

TI  - The Clinical Significance of Drug-Food Interactions of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168531 [doi]
LID - 8531
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For 
      almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of 
      anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially 
      considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical 
      observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food 
      ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain 
      substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially 
      affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to 
      evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Patients treated with 
      anticoagulants should avoid products containing St. John's wort and take special 
      care with other food ingredients. As the interest in dietary supplements is on 
      the rise, healthcare providers can contribute to the development of well-designed 
      clinical trials on interactions between DOACs and food, and distribute sufficient 
      knowledge about the proper use of these supplements among patients.

AB  - Histamine is a mediator of many physiological processes. It plays an important 
      role in modulating allergy reactions and immune system responses. H1 receptor is 
      a therapeutic target for drugs applied in allergic diseases such as allergic 
      rhinoconjunctivitis, urticarial, or atopic dermatitis. H1-antihistamines display 
      different chemical structures, pharmacokinetics and a potential for drug-drug and 
      drug-food interactions. Drug-food interactions are known to reduce therapeutic 
      effects of the medicine, as well as to induce a potent adverse drug reactions. 
      Considering it all, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the 
      importance of drug-food interaction for H1-antihistamine drugs. As non-sedating 
      second generation H1-antihistamines remain to be drugs of choice in treating 
      allergic conditions, the review has been focused on this particular class of 
      medicines. The aim of this paper is to examine the evidence of food-drug and 
      food-alcohol interactions for second generation H1-antihistamine drugs. A 
      systematic literature queries were performed in the following databases: Medline 
      (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science (all from their 
      inception date till October 2016). The queries covered nine specific names of 
      second generation anthistamine drugs, namely bilastine, cetirizine, 
      desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, 
      and rupatadine, in combinations with such terms as "food", "juice", "grapefruit", 
      "fruits", "alcohol", "pharmacokinetics", and "meal". Additional publications were 
      found by checking all the reference lists. Where none data on drug-food 
      interaction could be found within the investigated databases, a specific drug 
      prescribing information was used. 2326 publications were identified with the 
      database queries. Articles were subjected to analysis by reviewing their title, 
      abstract and full text; duplicated papers were removed. Having collected a 
      complete set of data, a critical review was undertaken. For selected 
      H1-antihistamines food, fruit juices or alcohol consumption may significantly 
      impact the efficacy and safety of the therapy. This issue shall be well 
      understood to educate patients properly, as it provides the major therapeutic 
      element in allergic diseases.

TI  - Selected Food/Herb-Drug Interactions: Mechanisms and Clinical Relevance.
PG  - e423-e433
LID - 10.1097/MJT.0000000000000705 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food/Herb-drug interactions have become a major problem in health 
      care. These interactions can lead to loss of therapeutic efficacy or toxic 
      effects of drugs. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: To probe the clinical relevance of such 
      interactions, the impact of food/herb intake on the clinical effects of drug 
      administration has to be evaluated. Failure to identify and efficiently manage 
      food-drug interactions can lead to serious consequences. A comprehensive 
      knowledge of the mechanisms that underpin variability in disposition will help 
      optimize therapy. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of literatures from relevant 
      databases were conducted. A total of 58 original scientific reports/review 
      articles were obtained with the search strategy; of which 25 were found eligible 
      to be included in the present review. Required data were extracted from these 
      studies, and their methodologies were assessed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review updates our knowledge on clinical food-drug interactions with emphasis on 
      mechanism and clinical implications. Results obtained from literature search 
      identified interactions with selected foods/herbs generated from in vivo and in 
      vitro studies. For example, interaction studies in humans revealed a reduction in 
      the bioavailability of mercaptopurine when taken concurrently with substances 
      containing xanthine oxidase (eg, cow milk); a reduction in the bioavailability of 
      quinine with Garcinia kola; increased bioavailability/toxicity of felodipine, 
      nifedipine, saquinavir, sildenafil with grape juice; increased bioavailability of 
      felodipine, cisapride with red wine and diminished bioavailability of 
      fexofenadine with apple. Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms are 
      implicated in many of these interactions. By evaluating the dietary patterns of 
      patients and use of prescribed medications, health professionals will be well 
      informed of potential interactions and associated adverse effects.

AB  - This article reviews the major physiological and physicochemical principles of 
      the effect of food and gastrointestinal (GI) pH on the absorption and 
      bioavailability of oral drugs, and the various absorption models that are used to 
      describe/predict oral drug absorption. The rate and extent of oral drug 
      absorption is determined by a complex interaction between a drug's 
      physicochemical properties, GI physiologic factors, and the nature of the 
      formulation administered. GI pH is an important factor that can markedly affect 
      oral drug absorption and bioavailability as it may have significant influence on 
      drug dissolution & solubility, drug release, drug stability, and intestinal 
      permeability. Different regions of the GI tract have different drug absorptive 
      properties. Thus, the transit time in each GI region and its variability between 
      subjects may contribute to the variability in the rate and/or extent of drug 
      absorption. Food-drug interactions can result in delayed, decreased, increased, 
      and sometimes un-altered drug absorption. Food effects on oral absorption can be 
      achieved by direct and indirect mechanisms. Various models have been proposed to 
      describe oral absorption ranging from empirical models to the more sophisticated 
      "mechanism-based" models. Through understanding of the physicochemical and 
      physiological rate-limiting factors affecting oral absorption, modellers can 
      implement simplified population-based modelling approaches that are less complex 
      than whole-body physiologically-based models but still capture the essential 
      elements in a physiological way and hence will be more suited for population 
      modelling of large clinical data sets. It will also help formulation scientists 
      to better predict formulation performance and to develop formulations that 
      maximize oral bioavailability.

AB  - Drug transporters are considered to be determinants of drug disposition and 
      effects/toxicities by affecting the absorption, distribution, and excretion of 
      drugs. Drug transporters are generally divided into solute carrier (SLC) family 
      and ATP binding cassette (ABC) family. Widely studied ABC family transporters 
      include P-glycoprotein (P-GP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and 
      multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs). SLC family transporters related to drug 
      transport mainly include organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), organic 
      anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters (OCTs), organic 
      cation/carnitine transporters (OCTNs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and 
      multidrug/toxin extrusions (MATEs). These transporters are often expressed in 
      tissues related to drug disposition, such as the small intestine, liver, and 
      kidney, implicating intestinal absorption of drugs, uptake of drugs into 
      hepatocytes, and renal/bile excretion of drugs. Most of therapeutic drugs are 
      their substrates or inhibitors. When they are comedicated, serious drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) may occur due to alterations in intestinal absorption, 
      hepatic uptake, or renal/bile secretion of drugs, leading to enhancement of their 
      activities or toxicities or therapeutic failure. This chapter will illustrate 
      transporter-mediated DDIs (including food drug interaction) in human and their 
      clinical significances.
