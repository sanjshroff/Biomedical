AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st 
      century with more than 257 million cases and over 5.17 million deaths reported 
      worldwide (as of November 23, 2021. Various agents were initially proclaimed to 
      be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. 
      Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of 
      therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved. 
      Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led 
      to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease 
      including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332). Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated 
      using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the 
      novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral 
      antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, 
      based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease 
      Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of 
      non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of 
      progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 
      % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause 
      compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset 
      (primary endpoint). However, there still exists a great need for the development 
      of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient 
      in many cases. Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective 
      modalities to control the pandemic. In the current review, we provide an update 
      on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning 
      the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on 
      currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal 
      antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID™ summarizing the 
      latest original studies and meta-analyses. Moreover, we aim to discuss other 
      currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or 
      only limited therapeutic activity. The results of recent studies report that 
      hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with 
      incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as 
      amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to almost all nooks 
      and corners of the world. There are numerous potential approaches to 
      pharmacologically fight COVID-19: small-molecule drugs, interferon therapies, 
      vaccines, oligonucleotides, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. Medications are 
      being developed to target the spike, membrane, nucleocapsid or envelope proteins. 
      The spike protein is also a critical target for vaccine development. 
      Immunoinformatic approaches are being used for the identification of B cell and 
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Different 
      vaccine vectors are also being developed. Chemical and physical methods such as 
      formaldehyde, UV light or β-propiolactone are being deployed for the preparation 
      of inactivated virus vaccine. Currently, there are many vaccines undergoing 
      clinical trials. Even though mRNA and DNA vaccines are being designed and moved 
      into clinical trials, these types of vaccines are yet to be approved by 
      regulatory bodies for human use. This review focuses on the drugs and vaccines 
      being developed against the COVID-19.

AB  - At the stroke of the New Year 2020, COVID-19, a zoonotic disease that would turn 
      into a global pandemic, was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Although 
      unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic 
      diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting 
      severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular 
      level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so 
      that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have 
      provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical 
      approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the 
      identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, 
      replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed 
      opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS. 
      In this article, we first provided an overview of COVID-19 etiology vis-à-vis 
      other zoonotic diseases, particularly SARS and MERS. Then, we summarized the 
      characteristics of droplets/aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and how they 
      aid in the transmission of the virus among people. Moreover, we discussed the 
      molecular mechanisms that enable SARS-CoV-2 to access the host and become more 
      contagious than other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. Further, we outlined 
      various approaches that are currently being employed to diagnose and 
      symptomatically treat COVID-19 in the clinic. Finally, we reviewed various 
      approaches and technologies employed to develop vaccines against COVID-19 and 
      summarized the attempts to repurpose various classes of drugs and novel 
      therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the 
      world into the midst of a new pandemic. In the human body, the virus causes 
      COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, 
      which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of 
      past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus 
      that causes the disease SARS. Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is 
      transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated 
      surfaces. Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for 
      the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the United States and the United 
      Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis. 
      Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, 
      epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of 
      testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative 
      pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 179 
      million infections and 3.8 million deaths worldwide. Throughout the past year, 
      multiple vaccines have already been developed and used, while some others are in 
      the process of being developed. However, the emergence of new mutant strains of 
      SARS-CoV-2 that have demonstrated immune-evading characteristics and an increase 
      in infective capabilities leads to potential ineffectiveness of the vaccines 
      against these variants. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the 
      current understanding of the immunological mechanisms of the virus and vaccines, 
      as well as to investigate some key variants and mutations of the virus driving 
      the current pandemic and their impacts on current management guidelines. We also 
      discussed new technologies being developed for the prevention, treatment, and 
      detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we thoroughly reviewed and provided 
      crucial information on SARS-CoV-2 virology, vaccines and drugs being used and 
      developed for its prevention and treatment, as well as important variant strains. 
      Our review paper will be beneficial to health care professionals and researchers 
      so they can have a better understanding of the basic sciences, prevention, and 
      clinical treatment of COVID-19 during the pandemic. This paper consists of the 
      most updated information that has been available as of June 21, 2021.

AB  - BNT162b2 (Comirnaty(®); BioNTech and Pfizer) is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, 
      nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine for the prevention of the novel coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. BNT162b2 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the 
      expression of which elicits immune responses against the antigen in recipients. 
      In early December 2020, BNT162b2 received a temporary emergency use authorization 
      (EUA) in the UK and, subsequently, a series of approvals or authorizations for 
      emergency use in Bahrain, Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the USA. Soon after, 
      BNT162b2 received conditional marketing authorizations in Switzerland (19 
      December 2020) and the EU (21 December 2020) for active immunization to prevent 
      COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older. BNT162b2 
      is administered intramuscularly in a two-dose regimen. This article summarizes 
      the milestones in the development of BNT162b2 leading to these first approvals 
      for the prevention of COVID-19.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public 
      health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of 
      countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines 
      for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral 
      drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with 
      confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics 
      and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional 
      therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
      treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive 
      research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of 
      nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed 
      for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a 
      summary of current development and future perspectives.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused and is still causing 
      significant mortality and economic consequences all over the globe. As of today, 
      there are three U.S Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved vaccines, 
      Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Also, the antiviral drug 
      remdesivir and two combinations of monoclonal antibodies are authorized for 
      Emergency use (EUA) in certain patients. Furthermore, baricitinib was approved in 
      Japan (April 23, 2021). Despite available vaccines and EUA, pharmacological 
      therapy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is still highly required. 
      There are several ongoing clinical trials investigating the efficacy of 
      clinically available drugs in treating COVID-19. In this study, selected novel 
      pharmacological agents for the possible treatment of COVID-19 will be discussed. 
      Point of discussion will cover mechanism of action, supporting evidence for 
      safety and efficacy and reached stage in development. Drugs were classified into 
      three classes according to the phase of viral life cycle they target. Phase I, 
      the early infective phase, relies on supportive care and symptomatic treatment as 
      needed. In phase II, the pulmonary phase, treatment aims at inhibiting viral 
      entry or replication. Drugs used during this phase are famotidine, monoclonal 
      antibodies, nanobodies, ivermectin, remdesivir, camostat mesylate and other 
      antiviral agents. Finally, phase III, the hyper-inflammatory phase, tocilizumab, 
      dexamethasone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and melatonin are 
      used. The aim of this study is to summarize current findings and suggest gaps in 
      knowledge that can influence future COVID-19 treatment study design.

AB  - Due to the high prevalence and long incubation periods often without symptoms, 
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 
      millions of individuals globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic. Even with the recent approval of the anti-viral drug, remdesivir, and 
      Emergency Use Authorization of monoclonal antibodies against S protein, 
      bamlanivimab and casirimab/imdevimab, efficient and safe COVID-19 vaccines are 
      still desperately demanded not only to prevent its spread but also to restore 
      social and economic activities via generating mass immunization. Recent Emergency 
      Use Authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine may provide a pathway 
      forward, but monitoring of long-term immunity is still required, and diverse 
      candidates are still under development. As the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 
      pathogenesis and interactions with the immune system continues to evolve, a 
      variety of drug candidates are under investigation and in clinical trials. 
      Potential vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 include repurposed drugs, 
      monoclonal antibodies, antiviral and antigenic proteins, peptides, and 
      genetically engineered viruses. This paper reviews the virology and immunology of 
      SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapies for COVID-19 to vaccination, principles and 
      design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, and the promises and roles 
      of vaccine carriers in addressing the unique immunopathological challenges 
      presented by the disease.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen in December 2019, marked as one of the 
      highly pathogenic Coronavirus, and altogether this is the third coronavirus 
      attack that crossed the species barrier. As of 1(st) July 2020, it is spreading 
      around 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 10,185,374 and 503,862 
      confirmed cases and death reports, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 virus entered 
      into the target cells by binding with the hACE2 receptors. Spike glycoprotein 
      promotes the entry of the virus into host target cells. Literature reported a 
      significant mutation in receptor binding sites and membrane proteins of the 
      previous SARS-CoV to turned as SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for most dreadful 
      pandemic COVID-19. These modifications may be the probable reason for the extreme 
      transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. A hasty spread of COVID-19 
      throughout the world is highly threatening, but still, scientists do not have a 
      proper therapeutic measure to fight with it. Scientists are endeavoring across 
      the world to find effective therapy to combat COVID 19. Several drugs such as 
      Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Ribavirin, Ritonavir, Lopinavir, 
      Favipiravir, Interferons, Bevacizumab, Azithromycin, etc. are currently under 
      clinical trials. Vaccine development from various pharmaceutical companies and 
      research institutes is under progress, and more than ten vaccine candidates are 
      in the various phases of clinical trials. This review work highlighted the 
      origin, emergence, structural features, pathogenesis, and clinical features of 
      COVID-19. We have also discussed the in-line treatment strategies, preventive 
      measures, and vaccines to combat the emergence of COVID-19.
