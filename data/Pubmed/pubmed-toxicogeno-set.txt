AB  - Toxicogenomics (TGx) has contributed significantly to toxicology and now has 
      great potential to support moves towards animal-free approaches in regulatory 
      decision making. Here, we discuss in vitro TGx systems and their potential impact 
      on risk assessment. We raise awareness of the rapid advancement of genomics 
      technologies, which generates novel genomics features essential for enhanced risk 
      assessment. We specifically emphasize the importance of reproducibility in 
      utilizing TGx in the regulatory setting. We also highlight the role of machine 
      learning (particularly deep learning) in developing TGx-based predictive models. 
      Lastly, we touch on the topics of how TGx approaches could facilitate adverse 
      outcome pathways (AOP) development and enhance read-across strategies to further 
      regulatory application. Finally, we summarize current efforts to develop TGx for 
      risk assessment and set out remaining challenges.

AB  - The public Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) is an 
      innovative digital ecosystem that relates toxicological information for 
      chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and exposures to advance understanding 
      about human health. Literature-based, manually curated interactions are 
      integrated to create a knowledgebase that harmonizes cross-species heterogeneous 
      data for chemical exposures and their biological repercussions. In this biennial 
      update, we report a 20% increase in CTD curated content and now provide 45 
      million toxicogenomic relationships for over 16 300 chemicals, 51 300 genes, 5500 
      phenotypes, 7200 diseases and 163 000 exposure events, from 600 comparative 
      species. Furthermore, we increase the functionality of chemical-phenotype content 
      with new data-tabs on CTD Disease pages (to help fill in knowledge gaps for 
      environmental health) and new phenotype search parameters (for Batch Query and 
      Venn analysis tools). As well, we introduce new CTD Anatomy pages that allow 
      users to uniquely explore and analyze chemical-phenotype interactions from an 
      anatomical perspective. Finally, we have enhanced CTD Chemical pages with new 
      literature-based chemical synonyms (to improve querying) and added 1600 amino 
      acid-based compounds (to increase chemical landscape). Together, these updates 
      continue to augment CTD as a powerful resource for generating testable hypotheses 
      about the etiologies and molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally 
      influenced diseases.

AB  - This chapter reviews the current knowledge and recent progress in the field of 
      environmental, aquatic ecotoxicogenomics with a focus on transcriptomic methods. 
      In ecotoxicogenomics the omics technologies are applied for the detection and 
      assessment of adverse effects in the environment, and thus are to be 
      distinguished from omics used in human toxicology [Snape et al., Aquat Toxicol 
      67:143-154, 2004]. Transcriptomic methods in ecotoxicology are applied to gain a 
      mechanistic understanding of toxic effects on organisms or populations, and thus 
      aim to bridge the gap between cause and effect. A worthwhile effect-based 
      interpretation of stressor induced changes on the transcriptome is based on the 
      principle of phenotypic-anchoring [Paules, Environ Health Perspect 111:A338-A339, 
      2003]. Thereby, changes on the transcriptomic level can only be identified as 
      effects if they are clearly linked to a specific stressor-induced effect on the 
      macroscopic level. By integrating those macroscopic and transcriptomic effects, 
      conclusions on the effect-inducing type of the stressor can be drawn. 
      Stressor-specific effects on the transcriptomic level can be identified as 
      stressor-specific induced pathways, transcriptomic patterns, or 
      stressors-specific genetic biomarkers. In this chapter, examples of the combined 
      application of macroscopic and transcriptional effects for the identification of 
      environmental stressors, such as aquatic pollutants, are given and discussed. By 
      means of these examples, challenges on the way to a standardized application of 
      transcriptomics in ecotoxicology are discussed. This is also done against the 
      background of the application of transcriptomic methods in environmental 
      regulation such as the EU regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
      Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).

AB  - The wider applications of nanoparticles (NPs) has evoked a world-wide concern due 
      to their possible risk of toxicity in humans and other organisms. Aggregation and 
      accumulation of NPs into cell leads to their interaction with biological 
      macromolecules including proteins, nucleic acids and cellular organelles, which 
      eventually induce toxicological effects. Application of toxicogenomics to 
      investigate molecular pathway-based toxicological consequences has opened new 
      vistas in nanotoxicology research. Indeed, genomic approaches appeared as a new 
      paradigm in terms of providing information at molecular levels and have been 
      proven to be as a powerful tool for identification and quantification of global 
      shifts in gene expression. Toxicological responses of NPs have been discussed in 
      this chapter with the aim to provide a clear understanding of the molecular 
      mechanism of NPs induced toxicity both in in vivo and in vitro test models.

LID - 10.3390/nano10040708 [doi]
LID - 708
AB  - Transcriptomics data are relevant to address a number of challenges in 
      Toxicogenomics (TGx). After careful planning of exposure conditions and data 
      preprocessing, the TGx data can be used in predictive toxicology, where more 
      advanced modelling techniques are applied. The large volume of molecular profiles 
      produced by omics-based technologies allows the development and application of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) methods in TGx. Indeed, the publicly available omics 
      datasets are constantly increasing together with a plethora of different methods 
      that are made available to facilitate their analysis, interpretation and the 
      generation of accurate and stable predictive models. In this review, we present 
      the state-of-the-art of data modelling applied to transcriptomics data in TGx. We 
      show how the benchmark dose (BMD) analysis can be applied to TGx data. We review 
      read across and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) modelling methodologies. We 
      discuss how network-based approaches can be successfully employed to clarify the 
      mechanism of action (MOA) or specific biomarkers of exposure. We also describe 
      the main AI methodologies applied to TGx data to create predictive classification 
      and regression models and we address current challenges. Finally, we present a 
      short description of deep learning (DL) and data integration methodologies 
      applied in these contexts. Modelling of TGx data represents a valuable tool for 
      more accurate chemical safety assessment. This review is the third part of a 
      three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.

AB  - Toxicogenomics, the application of genomics to toxicology, was described as 'a 
      new era' for toxicology. Standard toxicity tests typically involve a number of 
      short-term bioassays that are costly, time consuming, require large numbers of 
      animals and generally focus on a single end point. Toxicogenomics was heralded as 
      a way to improve the efficiency of toxicity testing by assessing gene regulation 
      across the genome, allowing rapid classification of compounds based on 
      characteristic expression profiles. Gene expression microarrays could measure and 
      characterise genome-wide gene expression changes in a single study and while 
      transcriptomic profiles that can discriminate between genotoxic and non-genotoxic 
      carcinogens have been identified, challenges with the approach limited its 
      application. As such, toxicogenomics did not transform the field of genetic 
      toxicology in the way it was predicted. More recently, next generation sequencing 
      (NGS) technologies have revolutionised genomics owing to the fact that hundreds 
      of billions of base pairs can be sequenced simultaneously cheaper and quicker 
      than traditional Sanger methods. In relation to genetic toxicology, and thousands 
      of cancer genomes have been sequenced with single-base substitution mutational 
      signatures identified, and mutation signatures have been identified following 
      treatment of cells with known or suspected environmental carcinogens. RNAseq has 
      been applied to detect transcriptional changes following treatment with 
      genotoxins; modified RNAseq protocols have been developed to identify adducts in 
      the genome and Duplex sequencing is an example of a technique that has recently 
      been developed to accurately detect mutation. Machine learning, including 
      MutationSeq and SomaticSeq, has also been applied to somatic mutation detection 
      and improvements in automation and/or the application of machine learning 
      algorithms may allow high-throughput mutation sequencing in the future. This 
      review will discuss the initial promise of transcriptomics for genetic 
      toxicology, and how the development of NGS technologies and new machine learning 
      algorithms may finally realise that promise.

AB  - The toxicity evaluation system of environmental pollutants has undergone numerous 
      changes due to the application of new technologies. Single-cell toxicogenomics is 
      rapidly changing our view on environmental toxicology by increasing the 
      resolution of our analysis to the level of a single cell. Applications of this 
      technology in environmental toxicology have begun to emerge and are rapidly 
      expanding the portfolio of existing technologies and applications. Here, we first 
      summarized different methods involved in single-cell isolation and amplification 
      in single-cell sequencing process, compared the advantages and disadvantages of 
      different methods, and analyzed their development trends. Then, we reviewed the 
      main advances of single-cell toxicogenomics in environmental toxicology, 
      emphatically analyzed the application prospects of this technology in identifying 
      the target cells of pollutants in early embryos, clarifying the heterogeneous 
      response of cell subtypes to pollutants, and finding pathogenic bacteria in 
      unknown microbes, and highlighted the unique characteristics of this approach 
      with high resolution, high throughput, and high specificity by examples. We also 
      offered a prediction of the further application of this technology and the 
      revolution it brings in environmental toxicology. Overall, these advances will 
      provide practical solutions for controlling or mitigating exogenous toxicological 
      effects that threaten human and ecosystem health, contribute to improving our 
      understanding of the physiological processes affected by pollutants, and lead to 
      the emergence of new methods of pollution control.

AB  - It is still a major challenge to protect humans at workplaces and in the 
      environment. To cope with this task, it is a prerequisite to obtain detailed 
      information on the extent of chemical perturbations of biological pathways, in 
      particular, adaptive vs. adverse effects and the dose-response relationships. 
      This knowledge serves as the basis for the classification of non-carcinogens and 
      carcinogens and for further distinguishing carcinogens in genotoxic (DNA 
      damaging) or non-genotoxic compounds. Basing on quantitative dose-response 
      relationships, points of departures can be derived for chemical risk assessment. 
      In recent years, new methods have shown their capability to support the 
      established rodent models of carcinogenicity testing. In vitro high throughput 
      screening assays assess more comprehensively cell response. In addition, omics 
      technologies were applied to study the mode of action of chemicals whereby the 
      term "toxicogenomics" comprises various technologies such as transcriptomics, 
      epigenomics, or metabolomics. This review aims to summarize the current state of 
      toxicogenomic approaches in risk science and to compare them with established 
      ones. For example, measurement of global transcriptional changes generates 
      meaningful information for toxicological risk assessment such as accurate 
      classification of genotoxic/non-genotoxic carcinogens. Alteration in mRNA 
      expression offers previously unknown insights in the mode of action and enables 
      the definition of key events. Based on these, benchmark doses can be calculated 
      for the transition from an adaptive to an adverse state. In short, this review 
      assesses the potential and challenges of transcriptomics and addresses the impact 
      of other omics technologies on risk assessment in terms of hazard identification 
      and dose-response assessment.

      Expression Analysis for High Quality Data.
LID - 10.3390/nano10050903 [doi]
LID - 903
AB  - Preprocessing of transcriptomics data plays a pivotal role in the development of 
      toxicogenomics-driven tools for chemical toxicity assessment. The generation and 
      exploitation of large volumes of molecular profiles, following an appropriate 
      experimental design, allows the employment of toxicogenomics (TGx) approaches for 
      a thorough characterisation of the mechanism of action (MOA) of different 
      compounds. To date, a plethora of data preprocessing methodologies have been 
      suggested. However, in most cases, building the optimal analytical workflow is 
      not straightforward. A careful selection of the right tools must be carried out, 
      since it will affect the downstream analyses and modelling approaches. 
      Transcriptomics data preprocessing spans across multiple steps such as quality 
      check, filtering, normalization, batch effect detection and correction. 
      Currently, there is a lack of standard guidelines for data preprocessing in the 
      TGx field. Defining the optimal tools and procedures to be employed in the 
      transcriptomics data preprocessing will lead to the generation of homogeneous and 
      unbiased data, allowing the development of more reliable, robust and accurate 
      predictive models. In this review, we outline methods for the preprocessing of 
      three main transcriptomic technologies including microarray, bulk RNA-Sequencing 
      (RNA-Seq), and single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Moreover, we discuss the 
      most common methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes and 
      to perform a functional enrichment analysis. This review is the second part of a 
      three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.
