AB  - There is abundant variation in gene expression between individuals, populations, 
      and species. The evolution of gene regulation and expression within and between 
      species is thought to frequently contribute to adaptation. Yet considerable 
      evidence suggests that the primary evolutionary force acting on variation in gene 
      expression is stabilizing selection. We review here the results of recent studies 
      characterizing the evolution of gene expression occurring in cis (via linked 
      polymorphisms) or in trans (through diffusible products of other genes) and their 
      contribution to adaptation and response to the environment. We review the 
      evidence for buffering of variation in gene expression at the level of both 
      transcription and translation, and the possible mechanisms for this buffering. 
      Lastly, we summarize unresolved questions about the evolution of gene regulation.

TI  - Gene expression variability: the other dimension in transcriptome analysis.
PG  - 145-158

AB  - Transcriptome sequencing is a powerful technique to study molecular changes that 
      underlie the differences in physiological conditions and disease progression. A 
      typical question that is posed in such studies is finding genes with significant 
      changes between sample groups. In this respect expression variability is regarded 
      as a nuisance factor that is primarily of technical origin and complicates the 
      data analysis. However, it is becoming apparent that the biological variation in 
      gene expression might be an important molecular phenotype that can affect 
      physiological parameters. In this review we explore the recent literature on 
      technical and biological variability in gene expression, sources of expression 
      variability, (epi-)genetic hallmarks, and evolutionary constraints in genes with 
      robust and variable gene expression. We provide an overview of recent findings on 
      effects of external cues, such as diet and aging, on expression variability and 
      on other biological phenomena that can be linked to it. We discuss metrics and 
      tools that were developed for quantification of expression variability and 
      highlight the importance of future studies in this direction. To assist the 
      adoption of expression variability analysis, we also provide a detailed 
      description and computer code, which can easily be utilized by other researchers. 
      We also provide a reanalysis of recently published data to highlight the value of 
      the analysis method.

AB  - Visualization of transcription in living cells has taught us that genes are often 
      transcribed in bursts, with periods of gene activity interspersed by periods of 
      inactivity. Recently, technological advances in live-cell imaging have provided a 
      more detailed picture of the characteristics of transcriptional bursts, and have 
      allowed direct visualization of the upstream regulatory steps of bursting at 
      single-molecule resolution. In this review, we highlight the latest insights into 
      transcription dynamics and we discuss recent developments in understanding the 
      regulation of transcriptional bursting through the binding kinetics of 
      transcription factors, enhancer-promoter interactions and clustering/phase 
      separation of the transcriptional machinery.

AB  - Many mechanisms contribute to regulation of gene expression to ensure coordinated 
      cellular behaviors and fate decisions. Transcriptional responses to external 
      signals can consist of many hundreds of genes that can be parsed into different 
      categories based on kinetics of induction, cell-type and signal specificity, and 
      duration of the response. Here we discuss the structure of transcription programs 
      and suggest a basic framework to categorize gene expression programs based on 
      characteristics related to their control mechanisms. We also discuss possible 
      evolutionary implications of this framework.

AB  - Mammalian circadian behaviors are orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
      (SCN) in the ventral hypothalamus, but the number of SCN cell types and their 
      functional roles remain unclear. We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to 
      identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN and to characterize their 
      circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns. We identified eight major 
      cell types, with each type displaying a specific pattern of circadian gene 
      expression. Five SCN neuronal subtypes, each with specific combinations of 
      markers, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light 
      responsiveness. Through a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse 
      SCN at single-cell resolution, we obtained a standardized SCN atlas containing 
      the spatial distribution of these subtypes and gene expression. Furthermore, we 
      observed heterogeneous circadian gene expression between SCN neuron subtypes. 
      Such a spatiotemporal pattern of gene regulation within the SCN may have an 
      important function in the circadian pacemaker.

AB  - In eukaryote cells,transcription from genome DNA is a key process of gene 
      expression.The transcription products contain not only messenger RNAs that code 
      proteins,but also various types of non-coding RNAs.During transcription,some of 
      the gene loci produce more than one kind of RNA molecule,including coding RNAs 
      and more often non-coding RNAs.These gene loci that generate several kinds of RNA 
      molecules are named supergenes.According to the transcription pattern,supergenes 
      are divided into three types,known as types Ⅰ,Ⅱ and Ⅲ.In this review,we summarize 
      the transcription pattern of each type of supergene,and exposit the role of these 
      genes in cells.

AB  - SUMMARY: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database provides an invaluable 
      resource of publicly available gene expression data that can be integrated and 
      analyzed to derive new hypothesis and knowledge. In this context, gene expression 
      meta-analysis (geMAs) is increasingly used in several fields to improve study 
      reproducibility and discovering robust biomarkers. Nevertheless, integrating data 
      is not straightforward without bioinformatics expertise. Here, we present ImaGEO, 
      a web tool for geMAs that implements a complete and comprehensive meta-analysis 
      workflow starting from GEO dataset identifiers. The application integrates GEO 
      datasets, applies different meta-analysis techniques and provides functional 
      analysis results in an easy-to-use environment. ImaGEO is a powerful and useful 
      resource that allows researchers to integrate and perform meta-analysis of GEO 
      datasets to lead robust findings for biomarker discovery studies. AVAILABILITY 
      AND IMPLEMENTATION: ImaGEO is accessible at http://bioinfo.genyo.es/imageo/. 
      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
      online.

AB  - Gene expression in individual cells can be surprisingly noisy. In unicellular 
      organisms this noise can be functional; for example, by allowing a subfraction of 
      the population to prepare for environmental stress. The role of gene expression 
      noise in multicellular organisms has, however, remained unclear. In this review, 
      we discuss how new techniques are revealing an unexpected level of variability in 
      gene expression between and within genetically identical plants. We describe 
      recent progress as well as speculate on the function of transcriptional noise as 
      a mechanism for generating functional phenotypic diversity in plants.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation in metazoans occurs through long-range genomic 
      contacts between enhancers and promoters, and most genes are transcribed in 
      episodic "bursts" of RNA synthesis. To understand the relationship between these 
      two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream 
      signals, we describe the use of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C 
      measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive 
      TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and 
      variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in 
      inactive times gives rise to the widely observed "noise" in human gene expression 
      and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue. We derive a 
      mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription, chromosome 
      structure, and the cell's ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that 
      hypervariability is largely dynamic and does not reflect a stable biological 
      state.

AB  - The ability to control gene expression via small molecule effectors is important 
      in basic research as well as in future gene therapy applications. Although 
      transcription factor-based systems are widely used, they are not well suited for 
      certain applications due to a lack of functionality, limited available coding 
      space, and potential immunogenicity of the regulatory proteins. RNA-based 
      switches fill this gap since they can be designed to respond to effector 
      compounds utilizing ligand-sensing aptamers. These systems are very modular since 
      the aptamer can be combined with a variety of different expression platforms. 
      RNA-based switches have been constructed that allow for controlling gene 
      expression in diverse contexts. Here we discuss latest developments and 
      applications of aptamer-based gene expression switches in eukaryotes.
